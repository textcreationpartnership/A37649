            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have in a former TreatiÅ¿e Vindicated certain Scriptures, which I produced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t Mr. <hi>Knowles</hi> his abÅ¿urd and deÅ¿tructive opinion againÅ¿t the Divinity of ChriÅ¿t, from Å¿uch corrupt gloÅ¿Å¿es which he did put upon them, in a Printed paper of his, Intituled, <hi>A friendly debate on a weighty Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<pb facs="tcp:48559:3"/> &amp;c.</hi> And in my clearing of <hi>Ioh. 8. 58.</hi> (which he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly darkned and falÅ¿ified, by the interpretation which he put upon it) I encountred with the many arguments and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ive Å¿enÅ¿es of Scripture which he had made uÅ¿e of, and in which he had placed the whole Å¿trength he had, for the upholding of that his heterodox and dangerous do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which he vented in <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ter,</hi> with too great Å¿ucceÅ¿s, to the diÅ¿turbing of the faith of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: And whether <hi>I</hi> have not razed his whole building to the
<pb facs="tcp:48559:3"/> very ground, (which in three po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿itions he Å¿et up &amp; fortified) and whether <hi>I</hi> have not digged up the very foundation of it, &amp; taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way every Å¿upporter of it; <hi>I</hi> leave it to the judicious, unprejudiced, and diÅ¿-ingaged Readers to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine betwixt us.</p>
            <p>Truth (after a little time of patient expectance) will prevaile againÅ¿t, and triumph over er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, becauÅ¿e it hath the God of truth to engage for it, who can Å¿trengthen any weak contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inÅ¿trument (whom he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eth to imploy) to become migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb facs="tcp:48559:4"/> in the defence of it.</p>
            <p>My hope is, that enough hath already been repreÅ¿ented to Å¿atisfie all ingenuous dubious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons concerning the truth of ChriÅ¿ts Godhead, and therefore it is not abÅ¿olutely needful to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the Å¿etting forth of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother TreatiÅ¿e: But leÅ¿t there Å¿hould be any occaÅ¿ion of glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing adminiÅ¿tred to him, or others, BecauÅ¿e <hi>I</hi> replyed only to Å¿ome part of his writing or Printed paper, and not to the whole; and leÅ¿t he Å¿hould comfort himÅ¿elf with conceits of the unanÅ¿wer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneÅ¿s
<pb facs="tcp:48559:4"/> of that which is behind of it, and is unreplyed to: and leÅ¿t the truth Å¿hould Å¿uffer in Å¿uch Scriptures which remain unexamined by me, by his wreÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them from their genuine Å¿enÅ¿e, and my not freeing of them from Å¿uch abuÅ¿e; <hi>I</hi> have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to carry on my reply unto the remainder of his Book, that nothing that is material therein may be objected againÅ¿t me, as pretermitted by me.</p>
            <p>And becauÅ¿e <hi>I</hi> did well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tand that Å¿ome would lie at advantages, and would give it
<pb facs="tcp:48559:5"/> out that Mr. <hi>Knowles</hi> his book was never anÅ¿wered; if any part be unanÅ¿wered, and would object againÅ¿t me, that <hi>I</hi> was not able to defend all the Scriptures and arguments produced by my Å¿elf, and impugned by him, but did Å¿hamefully deÅ¿ert them, and not reÅ¿cue them from the force of his battery which he made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t them: And becauÅ¿e in the vindicating of my arguments, <hi>I</hi> foreÅ¿aw that <hi>I</hi> Å¿hould be neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿itated to diÅ¿cuÅ¿s and diÅ¿cover the weightineÅ¿s of the point in controverÅ¿ie, and that it is not
<pb facs="tcp:48559:5"/> Å¿o light and trivial as Å¿ome would make it, but that it is of higheÅ¿t concernment, and that all oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Godhead of ChriÅ¿t do oppugn mens Å¿alvation, and that Å¿uch an opinion that gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ayeth ChriÅ¿ts Diety, is no leÅ¿Å¿e then damnable; therefore <hi>I</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in my former TreatiÅ¿e to compleat my reply, and therein to attempt the giving Å¿atisfaction in that point (which only to mention was greatly offenÅ¿ive to many precious ChriÅ¿tians) <hi>viz.</hi> that Faith in ChriÅ¿t conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a meer creature, and
<pb facs="tcp:48559:6"/> nothing more, is a falÅ¿e Faith, and cannot Å¿ave; it therefore now concerned me (in point of Truth) to finiÅ¿h the work which <hi>I</hi> began; if God Å¿hall be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed to Å¿hine upon my Endeavors, Å¿o far as to caÅ¿t in any light to dark Å¿ouls thereby, that they may be able (not only to diÅ¿cern the falÅ¿hood of Å¿uch a Doctrine, but) to Å¿ee into the horridneÅ¿s thereof, <hi>I</hi> have my reward; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>I</hi> lie down at Gods foot, waiting upon him, to accompliÅ¿h his own glory in what way he pleaÅ¿eth, aÅ¿Å¿uring my Å¿elf that his

               </p>
               <p>But he encounters with this Text, and would evade the force of it, in theÅ¿e words: <hi>How can you demonÅ¿trate</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>that theÅ¿e are the words of ChriÅ¿t,</hi> and do relate to him?</p>

                  <hi>Repl.</hi> 1. I do demonÅ¿trate it from that agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which theÅ¿e words in the 8. verÅ¿e have with the words of the 11. and of the 17. verÅ¿es, which words of both places do refer to ChriÅ¿t, by his own confeÅ¿Å¿ion, and without the contradiction of any, as the 13. and 17. verÅ¿es do evidence to the Reader, in which it appears to be ChriÅ¿t that aÅ¿Å¿umed the Titles of <hi>Alpha and Omega</hi> to himÅ¿elf.</p>
               <p>2. I do collect it, becauÅ¿e ChriÅ¿t is one of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48559:8"/> Å¿peakers which we uÅ¿ually meet with in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, but the Father is rarely or never found to be a Å¿peaker through this whole Book.</p>
               <p>3. BecauÅ¿e the things that are in this Book repreÅ¿ented, are given by the Father unto ChriÅ¿t, but are Å¿hewed and Å¿ignified by ChriÅ¿t unto his Å¿ervants; now this is one thing that ChriÅ¿t Å¿hewed, which reÅ¿pected himÅ¿elf what he was, <hi>I am</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>Alpha and Omega.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. BecauÅ¿e there are no more Å¿peakers in this Chapter, but ChriÅ¿t and <hi>John,</hi> who can be made evidently to appear; therefore all that is Å¿poken in it, muÅ¿t be referred to one of the two; but the 8. verÅ¿e cannot be referred to <hi>John,</hi> therefore to ChriÅ¿t.</p>
               <p>5. BecauÅ¿e it concludes the prooeme, and gives a period to the Preface, (as <hi>Pareus</hi> Å¿hews upon the place,) <hi>John</hi> had repreÅ¿ented him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in the clouds, in the 7. verÅ¿e, and then in the words of the 8. verÅ¿e, Å¿ets him before men, (for the conÅ¿olation of the righteous, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the wicked) as preÅ¿ent, calling to them, <hi>I am Alpha and Omega, &amp;c.</hi> who will make doubt of my coming? who can intercept it? <hi>I am Alpha and Omega, &amp;c.</hi> But he imagines other Arguments will be made uÅ¿e of, to prove this place to refer to ChriÅ¿t, and diÅ¿putes againÅ¿t them, his words are theÅ¿e:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You will peradventure Å¿ay, that the thing is</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:48559:8"/> 
                  <hi>evident, in that he is called Lord, or you will bring the TeÅ¿timony of learned Authors, who have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted the words as Å¿poken by ChriÅ¿t:</hi> And he confutes both theÅ¿e reaÅ¿ons, and Å¿aith, <hi>God, or the Father, diÅ¿tinct from ChriÅ¿t, is called Lord,</hi> Act. 3. 19. 20. <hi>&amp;c. And</hi> Beza (Å¿aith he) <hi>conceived that theÅ¿e words are Å¿poken of God, abÅ¿olutely taken.

                  <hi>Repl.</hi> The Title <hi>Lord,</hi> becauÅ¿e it is rarely at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the Father in the New TeÅ¿tament, and when it is attributed to him, it is done with Å¿uch clearneÅ¿s, that it is eaÅ¿ily diÅ¿cerned, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e it is firÅ¿t commonly attributed to ChriÅ¿t, therefore it may be a ground of a probable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that ChriÅ¿t is meant by it; but a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ary Argument cannot be deducted from it; therefore I wave it; and it had been wiÅ¿dom if he had done Å¿o alÅ¿o, till he had diÅ¿cerned that I had made uÅ¿e of it as an Argument. As for learned Interpreters, though I honour them much, yet it hath not been my cuÅ¿tom to bottom the Å¿enÅ¿e that I put upon Scriptures upon them; but to prove it from the Scripture, either the Text it Å¿elf or context, or Å¿ome other parallel place; therefore he might have Å¿pared his labour in citing Authors, unleÅ¿s I had provoked him thereto.</p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:48559:9"/>
               <p> But if he will produce Authors, why will he offer wrong to the Authors whom he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth? and make them Å¿peak that which they Å¿peak not? that hath been the way to uphold a rotten tenent, and he treads in that way. I cannot find the words he cites in <hi>Beza,</hi> and he mentions not the place; and if he can Å¿hew them in <hi>Beza,</hi> I can Å¿hew that <hi>Beza</hi> contradicts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf. If <hi>Beza</hi> have Å¿o expreÅ¿Å¿ed himÅ¿elf, proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly he would do it when he came to give the Å¿enÅ¿e of the place, but there his words are theÅ¿e: <hi>ChriÅ¿tus hic loquitur ut aeternus Deus, acÅ¿i diceret, ego is Å¿um ante quem nihil eÅ¿t, immo per quem factum eÅ¿t quicquid factum eÅ¿t, quicque ut omnia intereant, Å¿uperÅ¿tes illis omnibus mane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, &amp;c.</hi> That is, <hi>ChriÅ¿t here Å¿peaks as the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal God, as if he Å¿hould Å¿ay, I am he before whom there is nothing, yea and by whom every thing is made that is made, and am one who do abide, and am Å¿urviving when all other things periÅ¿h.</hi> As for <hi>Pareus,</hi> I confeÅ¿s he cites his words aright, and yet abuÅ¿eth him egregiouÅ¿ly; for though he grants that Å¿ome Orthodox Writers do apply theÅ¿e words to God, abÅ¿olutely conÅ¿idered, yet he doth not grant that they are Orthodox in their Interpretation of that Text, but diÅ¿putes againÅ¿t them, and renders reaÅ¿ons why the words muÅ¿t be applyed to ChriÅ¿t. And in the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48559:9"/> very place from whence he fetcheth thoÅ¿e words of <hi>Pareus,</hi> which he mentions in his Margin, theÅ¿e words immediately follow, <hi>cauÅ¿as tamen evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes Å¿ententiae huic obÅ¿tare, prius oÅ¿tendi,</hi> that is, though Å¿ome Orthodox Interpreters do apply theÅ¿e words to God abÅ¿olutely taken, or to the Trinity, yet I have before Å¿hewed manifeÅ¿t rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons which do croÅ¿s this Opinion of theirs. Now he mentions the former words of this Author, and Å¿ilenceth theÅ¿e latter words, and Å¿o deals unkindly and uncandidly with him.</p>
               <p>But he Å¿aith, <hi>We muÅ¿t betake our Å¿elves to reaÅ¿on, whereby the Spirit may convince us, of whom the Text in controverÅ¿ies is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tood.</hi>

               <p>

And this he might have obÅ¿erved from <hi>Beza,</hi> had he been willing to have had his eyes opened.</p>
               <p>As for the GloÅ¿s that he makes upon the words, I confuted it formerly in part, and have Å¿hewed in my other TreatiÅ¿e, that by <hi>beginning</hi> the firÅ¿t part of time is meant, and that the Verb or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle (was) Å¿hews a preexiÅ¿tence before the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, or before time was, and not that ChriÅ¿t had his firÅ¿t exiÅ¿tence then when the beginning was; for the heavens and the earth had their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iÅ¿tence then when time firÅ¿t was in the beginning
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48559:16"/> of it, and Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿ted together with it, as <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords it; but the Word was before it, and Å¿o was eternal, for nothing was before the beginning but eternity. And whereas he makes this to be the Å¿enÅ¿e of theÅ¿e words, <hi>The Word was with God; This JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t was a delight to the moÅ¿t high God, and did converÅ¿e with him;</hi> reÅ¿training high God to the Father, and excluding ChriÅ¿t, it is but the venting of his own conceit in Å¿tead of Truth; for God there is taken perÅ¿onally, and not eÅ¿Å¿entially, as I have Å¿hewed before often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times; and the meaning is, the perÅ¿on of the Son was with the perÅ¿on of the Father from all eternity, and was a delight before the world was founded, as from <hi>Pro.</hi> 8. appears, <hi>He was as one brought up with the Father from everlaÅ¿ting, and was daily his delight.</hi> But the Å¿enÅ¿e that he puts upon the laÅ¿t words <hi>(viz. and the Word was a God)</hi> is the moÅ¿t groÅ¿s of all, and palpably cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, <hi>viz. This JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t had power committed to him, whereby he might repreÅ¿ent the moÅ¿t High God:</hi> And the reaÅ¿on which he renders doth not make it more tollerable, <hi>viz. the name God is common to God and creatures:</hi> for I have Å¿hewed, that never any Å¿ingle perÅ¿on was called God ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿olutely without limitation and reÅ¿triction. And in this place it is Å¿aid, that ChriÅ¿t was God from the firÅ¿t, that he was, and he was when the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning was; and it is not Å¿aid that he began to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48559:17"/> be when the beginning was, therefore he was before, and conÅ¿equently he was God before; and it will follow that he was God from eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and not in regard of any power committed to him, whereby he might repreÅ¿ent the moÅ¿t high God; for there was neither heaven nor earth when he was God, over whom to exerciÅ¿e any power, nor any creature to whom to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent God. And I have Å¿hewed that power which he had, was power in himÅ¿elf (as life was in himÅ¿elf) and was not, neither could be power committed to him, power in him being Å¿uch as no creature was capable of, by which he at firÅ¿t created, and doth yet uphold the world, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3.</p>
               <p>And whereas he gives reaÅ¿ons from this text, why ChriÅ¿t Å¿hould not be the moÅ¿t high God, viz. <hi>BecauÅ¿e he is diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed from God, and God cannot be diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed from himÅ¿elf,</hi> he himÅ¿elf anÅ¿wers it by the mention which he makes of perÅ¿onality, ChriÅ¿t is diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed from God taken perÅ¿onally, <hi>viz.</hi> for the Father, from the perÅ¿on of the Father is ChriÅ¿t diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed, but not from God eÅ¿Å¿entially taken, nor from the eÅ¿Å¿ence of the Father, for Å¿o he and his Father are one. But he takes not upon him to anÅ¿wer us in this diÅ¿tinction, and to overthrow it, though he knows that our great Å¿trength lies in it, but inÅ¿teed of anÅ¿wering, chargeth us to Å¿ay that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48559:17"/> which we Å¿ay not, <hi>viz.</hi> that we call the Father God by way of eminency, and diÅ¿putes againÅ¿t this, as inconÅ¿iÅ¿tent to that coequality which we hold, and Å¿helters himÅ¿elf under it. But he wrongs us, for we Å¿ay the Son is called God as diÅ¿tinct from the Father, but not by way of eminency, they cannot both be eminent one above the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and yet coequal. That which follows of <hi>The God</hi> and <hi>A God</hi> which he flies to, as a reaÅ¿on why ChriÅ¿t is not the moÅ¿t high God, I have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wered before, and need Å¿ay no more of it.</p>

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48559:18"/> to do all good to his ApoÅ¿tles and DiÅ¿ciples in all places of the world, and in all conditions and neceÅ¿Å¿ities, in which they might be, and at all times, and yet not be eÅ¿Å¿entially preÅ¿ent with them? If he can declare it, let him declare it; In the mean time that parallel place, (which he cites from <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 3. compared with chap. 32. 9.) is againÅ¿t him, for God is inabled to do good to all, (and Å¿o to <hi>Jacob)</hi> by his eÅ¿Å¿ential preÅ¿ence with all, and in all, and Å¿o with <hi>Jacob,</hi> and in <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob.</hi> And though God have all the Angels to wait upon him, and all the creatures at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to go for him, and to do for him what he appoints, yet if he were not eÅ¿Å¿entially preÅ¿ent himÅ¿elf with all, and in all, he could not Å¿upply all with all good that they want; for he could not Å¿ee all and know all, if he were not preÅ¿ent in all, if he did not fill all, and if all did not live and move and had not being in him. Therefore the Lord argues in <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 24. from his filling all, to his knowing all, the words are theÅ¿e, <hi>Can any hide himÅ¿elf in Å¿ecret places, that I Å¿hall not Å¿ee him?</hi> do not I fill heaven and earth, Å¿aith the Lord? and if this be Å¿o of God, that he works all by his preÅ¿ence with all, then it is Å¿o of ChriÅ¿t alÅ¿o; and the words <hi>I will be with you,</hi> though they may extend to actions of love and kindneÅ¿s, and may compriÅ¿e well dealing and doing good within them, yet they do properly hold out the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48559:18"/> way and means in which ChriÅ¿t will be helpful to them, he is with them alwaies to take notice of their condition, and to apply himÅ¿elf thereto, and ChriÅ¿t doth aÅ¿Å¿ure them, that though he Å¿hall be bodily abÅ¿ent from them, and in heaven, yet in the eternal Spirit, in the divine nature, he is alwaies preÅ¿ent with them: In which Å¿enÅ¿e (he Å¿aith) that he the Son of man (though upon earth in his fleÅ¿h) was yet according to his diety in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>John</hi> 3. 13. and <hi>chap.</hi> 17. 24.</p>
               <p>But he goes on, and Å¿aith, <hi>JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent with his MeÅ¿Å¿engers, and deals well with them, when he doth inÅ¿truct, comfort, Å¿trengthen and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect them; and all theÅ¿e he doth in his abÅ¿ence by his Spirit, whom the Father hath Å¿ent in his name.</hi> John 14. 26.

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48559:19"/> doth effect all things by the Spirit, yet it is not onely falÅ¿e, but fooliÅ¿h in the Å¿enÅ¿e that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it, and in the words that he expreÅ¿Å¿eth it in.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

And the Å¿ending of the Spirit both by the Father and by the Son, are acts of counÅ¿el among the perÅ¿ons in the Godhead, as hath been fully declared in reference to ChriÅ¿t, who was Å¿ent of the Father, and yet gave himÅ¿elf.

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48559:21"/> and chief of the creatures, for the Spirit is more excellent then he, for the Spirit can be preÅ¿ent with all the ApoÅ¿tles in all the parts and Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mats of the World at one time, to inÅ¿truct them, comfort them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ChriÅ¿t is Å¿hut up in Heaven and cannot. And this is contradictory to himÅ¿elf, for he makes ChriÅ¿t the firÅ¿t of the creatures, and the Maker of the reÅ¿t, and the Lord of them, and he makes him a Spirit in his firÅ¿t exiÅ¿tence, and yet the Spirit that was made by him can be with all the ApoÅ¿tles, and DiÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and Saints alÅ¿o, and abide with them for ever, and adminiÅ¿ter to them all good, but ChriÅ¿t who is his Lord and Maker cannot. O monÅ¿trous and Å¿enÅ¿eleÅ¿s Opinion, wherein God leaves him to be confounded!</p>
               <p>But how contradictory to reaÅ¿on is this, that the Spirit Å¿hould be the inÅ¿trument of ChriÅ¿t, and Å¿o a creature inferiour to ChriÅ¿t, and yet be preÅ¿ent in all places in Heaven, in Earth, in the Sea, and every where, for where ever Saints be, there the Spirit is, &amp; Saints are in all theÅ¿e places, <hi>The Spirit is one that bears witneÅ¿s in Heaven,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 7. Therefore there he is, and he bears witneÅ¿s on Earth in the hearts of Believers, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 16. and therefore there he is. And the whole Spirit dwels in every Saint, for we do not read of any parts of the Spirit, into which he is divided, and if Saints be every
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48559:21"/> where, the whole Spirit is every where, and Å¿uch a boundleÅ¿s EÅ¿Å¿ence is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent to any creature; it is that which God himÅ¿elf arrogates as proper to him, <hi>do not I fill Heaven and Earth? Jer.</hi> 23. 24. whole God fils every place, and the whole Spirit fils every Saint. As bodies have their <hi>loca,</hi> their places; Å¿o Spirits, all created ones, have their <hi>ubi,</hi> their Å¿ome where, out of which and beyond which they are not; they are confined, if they be not circumÅ¿cribed; but of the Spirit it is Å¿aid, <hi>whither Å¿hall I go from thy Spirit, the Spirit is everywhere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is alÅ¿o extreamly repugnant to Scripture, that the Spirit Å¿hould be ChriÅ¿ts inÅ¿trument, and conÅ¿equently a creature, and it is as groÅ¿s as the denying of the Diety of ChriÅ¿t, and his HereÅ¿ie is multiplyed in this AÅ¿Å¿ertion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. An InÅ¿trument acts and works after the will of the principal efficient, but the Spirit af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his own will as himÅ¿elf pleaÅ¿eth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no inÅ¿trument.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The perÅ¿on by whom ChriÅ¿t wrought Miracles, was no inÅ¿trument, but ChriÅ¿t accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his humane nature wrought Miracles by the vertue and power of the Spirit, therefore he was no inÅ¿trument, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 28. <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 38.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He that was the uncture, with which ChriÅ¿t was annoynted and became more excellent and glorious then all his fellows; he that was the

               <p n="4">4. He that is the Spirit of God, and is to God as the Å¿pirit of a man is to man, he that alone knoweth the deep things of God and Å¿earcheth them; that is, hath deep full perfect knowledge of them, he cannot be an inÅ¿trument to ChriÅ¿t, to take what ChriÅ¿t a creature, (as he makes ChriÅ¿t to be) Å¿hews him, and no more, and to Å¿hew them to men, but the Spirit is the Spirit of God, and Å¿tands to God as the Spirit of a man Å¿tands to man; and Å¿earcheth the deep things of God, therefore cannot be an inÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to take from ChriÅ¿t, and bring and Å¿hew to men. And it is contrary to Scripture to make the Spirit a creature, as if he be a creatures inÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as he would make him) he muÅ¿t needs be.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He is called God by the ApoÅ¿tles of ChriÅ¿t, therefore he is God, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 3, 4. compared together, prove it: in the 3. ver. <hi>Peter</hi> Å¿aith to <hi>Ananias, Thou haÅ¿t lyed to the holy GhoÅ¿t;</hi> in the 4. verÅ¿. he Å¿aith, <hi>Thou haÅ¿t lyed to God:</hi>

But Å¿ome may object againÅ¿t this, and Å¿ay, that the holy GhoÅ¿t is not called the higheÅ¿t, but he is called the power of the HigheÅ¿t, or the vertue of the HigheÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e the HigheÅ¿t by the vertue of the holy GhoÅ¿t would form ChriÅ¿t in the womb of the Virgin, or would cauÅ¿e her to conceive, &amp; Å¿o the holy GhoÅ¿t and power are one thing, but not the holy GhoÅ¿t and the HigheÅ¿t: If this were true, yet Å¿eeing a perÅ¿on is Å¿poken of and not a thing, and this perÅ¿on is called the vertue or power of the HigheÅ¿t in Å¿o miraculous a work, he cannot be inferiour to the HigheÅ¿t; for he by whoÅ¿e force, and power, and vertue the higheÅ¿t Å¿hews himÅ¿elf to be the HigheÅ¿t, works as the HigheÅ¿t, muÅ¿t needs be as high as he, and if the Father Å¿hould be the HigheÅ¿t in this place, yet the holy GhoÅ¿t is made equal to him, which Å¿hews the Father and the holy GhoÅ¿t to be one in EÅ¿Å¿ence, though two in perÅ¿onality, becauÅ¿e there can be but one HigheÅ¿t.</p>
               <p>But it appears to be otherwiÅ¿e, that Spirit and power are not confounded, but diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed, and there diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed where God is mentioned in <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 18, 19. <hi>God made the Gentiles obedient to the GoÅ¿pel, through mighty Å¿igns and wonders done by the power of the Spirit of God;</hi> here is pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and Spirit, and God, and all diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed

               <p>I might Å¿peak of the attributes of the Spirit, which are proper to the moÅ¿t high God, and prove him to be Å¿uch, as of Omnipotency, Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿ciency, OmnipreÅ¿ence, &amp;c. But he himÅ¿elf hath held forth theÅ¿e in his Letter, when he lived about <hi>GloceÅ¿ter,</hi> which in my former TreatiÅ¿e is printed to the view of the World, at which time his eyes were open, and he Å¿aw theÅ¿e attributes in the Spirit, and acknowledged the holy GhoÅ¿t to be God upon the Å¿ight thereof, though

               <p>2. The words which he mentions in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,

               <p>3. The words of <hi>Beza</hi> upon the place do dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer greatly from the words he preÅ¿ents as his, and do not favour his expoÅ¿ition at all, but may well be interpreted Å¿o as to cohere with the uÅ¿e I make of that Text, <hi>Cum autem idem ipÅ¿e domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus paulo ante dixerit, &amp;c.</hi> Å¿aith <hi>Beza;</hi> that is, <hi>When as the Å¿elf-Å¿ame Lord JeÅ¿us had Å¿aid a little before, Me you Å¿hall not have alwayes, and was to aÅ¿cend a little after; it is apparent that there muÅ¿t be a diÅ¿tinction, reÅ¿pecting the maner and way of ChriÅ¿ts preÅ¿ence and abÅ¿ence; in body he is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent, but in vertue he is wholly moÅ¿t preÅ¿ent; in which vertue he doth communicate himÅ¿elf, and all</hi>

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48559:26"/> eye-Å¿ight he himÅ¿elf had, and what a vaÅ¿te in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenÅ¿ible underÅ¿tanding and knowledge he had, for the comfort of all true Saints, and for the terror of all Hypocrites in all the Churches; and this is maniffeÅ¿t from 23. ver. of the Å¿ame Chapter; &amp; had he but read the Chapter over, he would not have admired at me, <hi>viz.</hi> at my collection, but at his own AnÅ¿wers; <hi>I will kill her children</hi> (Å¿aith ChriÅ¿t) <hi>with death, and all the Churches Å¿hall know that I am he that Å¿earcheth the reines and hearts, &amp;c.</hi> In theÅ¿e words we may obÅ¿erve; firÅ¿t, what a knowledge it is that ChriÅ¿t hath of the works and wayes of the Church, and what it is he knows; it is an inward penetrating knowledge, it is of the moÅ¿t unÅ¿earchable parts, it is of the moÅ¿t hidden works, it is of the works of the hearts and reines of men. Secondly, how ChriÅ¿t came by this knowledge; not by any diÅ¿covery that any other made to him, but by and from himÅ¿elf he hath this knowledge; it is a knowledge which he hath in himÅ¿elf it is his own knowledge, I Å¿earch the hearts and the reines. Thirdly, for what end ChriÅ¿t declares this his exquiÅ¿ite and perfect knowledge of all things in man, which he hath in himÅ¿elf, that all the Churches may know who he was, what an one he was, more obÅ¿ervant of all Å¿ecret wickedneÅ¿s then they were aware of, that they might fear &amp; tremble more in reference to

Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what this Å¿cience or knowledge of ChriÅ¿t doth denotate and demonÅ¿trate ChriÅ¿t to be, no leÅ¿s then the moÅ¿t high God; for the moÅ¿t high God doth aÅ¿Å¿ume power and perfection of Å¿earching and trying hearts and reines to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf, as his own proper prerogative, which none is enabled to challenge; in <hi>Jer.</hi> 179 10. <hi>The heart is deceitful, and deÅ¿perately wicked, who can know it?</hi> as if he Å¿hould have Å¿aid, None can know it? But then he excepts himÅ¿elf, <hi>I the Lord Å¿earch the heart and try the reines;</hi> that is, I alone do it; and yet ChriÅ¿t attributes this high Divine tranÅ¿cendent knowledge to himÅ¿elf, and with Å¿uch Å¿uitable words, as if ChriÅ¿t were the perÅ¿on Å¿peaking in <hi>Jeremie,</hi> or as if the perÅ¿on Å¿peaking in <hi>Jeremie</hi> Å¿pake alÅ¿o in the Revelation, as if one and the Å¿ame perÅ¿on Å¿pake in both places for they challenge one &amp; the Å¿ame thing; &amp; the cloÅ¿e of the Å¿peech in both places is the Å¿ame, and it Å¿hews that one and the Å¿ame God Å¿peaks in both places, if not one and the Å¿ame perÅ¿on. And now if Mr. <hi>Knowles</hi> have any ingenuity in him, he will open his eyes, and lie under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of this Text, unleÅ¿s he have Å¿old himÅ¿elf to be deluded, and to Å¿educe others.</p>
               <p>It appears by what hath been preÅ¿ented, that he cannot evade the Å¿trength of this Text of <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 2. and the collection made there-from,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48559:27"/> with his inÅ¿tance of <hi>EliÅ¿ha,</hi> who knew what the King of <hi>Syria</hi> Å¿pake in his Bed-chamber, which was done, not by any wiÅ¿dome that was in him, but by the revelation of God; but ChriÅ¿ts knowledge was not Å¿uch, was not from an other but from and in himÅ¿elf: But he reÅ¿ts not in that, but flies to the Spirit, <hi>which</hi> (he Å¿aith) <hi>was given unto him beyond all meaÅ¿ure,</hi> Joh. 3. 34. But what is this Spirit which was given to him, which made him thus wiÅ¿e, that he could know all the works of the Churches? This Spirit is in his opinion but a creature; he called him but very lately ChriÅ¿ts inÅ¿trument; and his whole Å¿cope in his Book is to Å¿hew that the Father a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is God, the moÅ¿t high God; therefore according to him the Spirit is but a creature: And Å¿hall ChriÅ¿t have all this help from a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to know all the works of the Churches? Doth the Spirit himÅ¿elf know all the hidden workings of the hearts of all Churches? and of all Saints? There are works of the hearts and reines; doth the Spirit know them, if he be but a creature? The Scripture tels us that none can know them but God, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 26. 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 139. 23. and <hi>Jer.</hi> 11. 20. <hi>&amp; Chap.</hi> 20. 12. But he Å¿aith the Spirit is not God, therefore cannot know Å¿uch things; therefore by the gift of him ChriÅ¿t cannot come to know Å¿uch things. And how comes the Spirit being but a creature to know more then
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48559:27"/> ChriÅ¿t, and to be ChriÅ¿ts inÅ¿tructor, when ChriÅ¿t is the chief of all the creatures, and a God in wiÅ¿dom and Å¿trength in compariÅ¿on of them according to his opinion? is not here an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iÅ¿tency which doth always attend falÅ¿hood? Nor can the Spirit without meaÅ¿ure be given to ChriÅ¿t, if the Spirit (as he aÅ¿Å¿erts) be but a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for then himÅ¿elf is meaÅ¿ured, being finite, and not infinite, and muÅ¿t be given in meaÅ¿ure; therefore by the gift of him ChriÅ¿t cannot know all things. Yea, further it may be Å¿aid, though the Spirit were infinite, as indeed he is infinite, and is good (whatever he weakly and Å¿infully aÅ¿Å¿erts to the contrary) yet ChriÅ¿t being but a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (as he deÅ¿perately argues) he cannot be given without meaÅ¿ure; for things are received according to the capacity of that which doth receive, and not above it; and Å¿o ChriÅ¿t being finite (as he holds) and meaÅ¿urable, doth Å¿tint and limit, and bring to a bound, and to a meaÅ¿ure all that he receives; and indeed his humane nature that did receive the Spirit, being finite, was not capable of the Spirit without meaÅ¿ure, though the Spirit himÅ¿elf be without meaÅ¿ure; but it is an hyperbolical expreÅ¿Å¿ion, and the meaning is, ChriÅ¿t had aboundance of the Spirit, as he was man, beyond all men, and all creatures; but no finite proportion of the Spirit will enable ChriÅ¿t as man to know
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48559:28"/> by his own wiÅ¿dom that reÅ¿ides in him, all the works of all the Churches; for none but the Å¿earcher of all hearts can do that, becauÅ¿e there are may hidden works of the heart: Now this Searcher of hearts is God only, therefore ChriÅ¿t is God.</p>

Or, Å¿aith he, it
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48559:28"/> may reÅ¿pect the humane nature of ChriÅ¿t. ChriÅ¿t as man acts nothing, doth nothing apart from the will of his own Diety; for though the Divine will and the humane be two wils in number, yet they be not two but one in conÅ¿ent and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Å¿o one with the Fathers will. And ChriÅ¿t as man, as he hears, that is, as the Father Å¿uggeÅ¿ts to him, Å¿o he judgeth, which is true of the Divine will in ChriÅ¿t Å¿uggeÅ¿ting to the humane. And <hi>Chemnitius</hi> in his Harmony, interprets the Sons not doing any thing of himÅ¿elf, to ariÅ¿e not out of the imbecillity of the Son, but from the abÅ¿olute and perfect identity of the Father and the Son in EÅ¿Å¿ence, and all eÅ¿Å¿ential proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and acts; and the Sons hearing, he expounds to be the Sons knowing together with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all things decreed in the Å¿ecret CounÅ¿el of the Divinty, or Divine EÅ¿Å¿ence. And without doubt, the undivided operations of the Father and Son are pointed out. <hi>As I hear I judge,</hi> Å¿aith ChriÅ¿t, and in <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 15. <hi>I judge no man,</hi> and ver. 50. <hi>the Father Å¿eeketh and judgeth,</hi> and yet in <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 22 <hi>The Father judgeth no man, but hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted all judgement to the Son;</hi> TheÅ¿e Scriptures cannot be reconciled better then to Å¿ay, they judge in one another, the Father in the Son, the Son in the Father, they act undividedly; the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is in ChriÅ¿t in all ChriÅ¿ts operations, and the Son Å¿ees and hears, and knows the Father, and

               <p>He concludes his anÅ¿wer to this text of <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 2. thus, <hi>Though he alwayes knew all things neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ary for the perfect diÅ¿charge of his offices, yet there was a time when he was excluded from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the hour and day of judgement,</hi> Mark 13. 32. <hi>But of that day and hour no one knoweth, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Angels that are in heaven, nor the Son, unleÅ¿s the Father: Therefore his knowledge was not formally of himÅ¿elf, nor alwaies perfect.</hi>

And as the Son of man, is higher then the Angels, and knoweth more then the Angels, having a more excellent anointment then they; therefore the gradation is conÅ¿iÅ¿tent,

ChriÅ¿t then had knowledge of the very preciÅ¿e time of judgement, and yet he had not knowledge, (he Å¿aith Å¿o himÅ¿elf) how is it to be underÅ¿tood? as he was the Son of man according to the man-hood he had not the knowledge thereof, but as he was the Son of God he had the knowledge thereof. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 15. was next produced by me, to prove the eternal generation of ChriÅ¿t by it; But he had perverted the true Å¿enÅ¿e of it before he came to it, and made uÅ¿e of it to Å¿erve his own purpoÅ¿e by it, while he was pleading for that unchriÅ¿t-like do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which he had received, and was ingaged to maintain it.

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48559:31"/> all, therefore not that he was firÅ¿t created. 2. In the beginning he was, but no mention of any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning that he had. 3.

ChriÅ¿t was born according to the fleÅ¿h, but he was not the firÅ¿t-born, but in fulneÅ¿Å¿e of time was born; therefore in reference to his humanity, and as he was the Å¿eed of the woman, he is not called firÅ¿t-born. 5. FirÅ¿t born and firÅ¿t-begotten are termes equivalent, and point at one and the Å¿ame thing, <hi>viz.</hi> or Å¿ome perÅ¿on that did perform Å¿uch an act as begetting of ChriÅ¿t. 6. FirÅ¿t-born, firÅ¿t-begotten and only-begotten are alike congruous; and may equally, Å¿o far as concerns the truth of the thing, be attributed to ChriÅ¿t; Å¿o that whatever is the meaning of Å¿uch titles or names, there is a peculiarity therein to ChriÅ¿t, and ChriÅ¿t hath therein no fellows; and Å¿o it can neither be applyed to creation, nor to ordinary and temporary generation; for it cannot be Å¿aid that ChriÅ¿t was onely created, nor onely genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and begotten, nor onely born; for there were numerous creatures created, and innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable generated in the ordinary way: But ChriÅ¿t was alone Å¿o begotten, and Å¿o born of God as none elÅ¿e were. 7.

               <p n="1">1. The book of the creatures Å¿peaks onely of one firÅ¿t cauÅ¿e, and principal agent of all things; of a Trinity of perÅ¿ons, in unity of eÅ¿Å¿ence, as principal agents in the work of creation, the whole creation is Å¿ilent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. If the book of the creatures were wholly Å¿ilent: yet if the book of the Scriptures be not Å¿ilent, we are to attend the book of the Scriptures; if the book of the creatures would have taught us all things that we ought to believe concerning God, what need had there been of the book of the Scriptures?</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:48559:32"/> 2 The book of the creatures doth teach many things which we underÅ¿tand not from them; the defect is in us, not in it: we are dul in apprehending, and <hi>Å¿low of heart in beleeving</hi> what the book of the Scriptures doth teach us, therefore may not conceive aright what the book of the Creatures doth teach us.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The heathen PhiloÅ¿ophers from the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of ReaÅ¿on have acknowledged a Trinity of PerÅ¿ons in the unity of EÅ¿Å¿ence; as <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus</hi> a French Lord, in that exquiÅ¿ite piece of his, called <hi>The trueneÅ¿Å¿e of Christian Religion,</hi> largely and Å¿atisfactorily Å¿hews, if the Reader will be at the pains to peruÅ¿e him.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The inanimate creatures have Å¿ome kind of impreÅ¿Å¿ion of the Trinity upon them; and <hi>one</hi> God in <hi>three</hi> PerÅ¿ons hath in a kind left his image and his reÅ¿emblance upon them: The <hi>Sun</hi> begets <hi>beams</hi> and <hi>rayes,</hi> and from both theÅ¿e proceeds <hi>light;</hi> and yet neither is the <hi>Sun</hi> before the <hi>beams,</hi> nor the <hi>beams</hi> before the <hi>light</hi> that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from them, but in order onely and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Å¿o far as the beams are begotten, and the light proceeds; but not in time: which doth adumbrate the coeternity of the Three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons. So alÅ¿o there is the Fountain, and there is the water that bubbles up, which is (as it were) begotten of the Fountain; and there is the Å¿tream that proceeds from both; and theÅ¿e are at once in time: for in the firÅ¿t moment
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48559:33"/> that there is a fountain, there is the bubling of water, or the riÅ¿ing up, or boyling of it; and no Å¿ooner is the bubling, but there is an iÅ¿Å¿uing or proceeding of water, the water runs from it, if there be paÅ¿Å¿age: and yet in order the fountain is firÅ¿t, the bubling is next, and the proceeding of water is laÅ¿t, but they are together in time; And may it not be Å¿aid that the impreÅ¿Å¿ion of the Trinity is here? but the character in which the Trinity is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the book of the creatures, is Å¿maller and darker then that every one can read; when yet things of the God-head, Å¿ome of them may more eaÅ¿ily be Å¿pelled forth.</p>

And if there be one God in three perÅ¿ons, (or which is all one) Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿ting three manner of ways, yet the three manner of ways of Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿ting, doth not make three Gods, nor three Agents. But there is no Å¿imilitude that will rightly and exactly, and fully in all things hold forth the working of God in trinity of perÅ¿ons; only Å¿ome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle crevice of light may be opened, to give a little inÅ¿ight into this truth.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Our Divines when they have confeÅ¿Å¿ed that God is known by the Creation, but have denyed that God the Father, Son, and Holy GhoÅ¿t are known thereby; they have meant it of a demonÅ¿trative knowledge which of God men may arrive at; but of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity they cannot; yet there may be Å¿ome things that may Å¿hadow it out, though very darkly.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It is certain, that that which is clearly Å¿een of God in the Creation, belongs to his EÅ¿Å¿ence.

               <p>But he objects againÅ¿t our Divines, for

               <p>
                  <hi>Yet by their leave, God is a PerÅ¿on, all acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being proper unto perÅ¿ons, therefore by their grant, the work of creation holds forth but one Agent: for it is not imaginable, that if there were more then one principall Agent, they Å¿hould not all be equally diÅ¿covered by the work.</hi>

Yet when it reÅ¿pects acting things without them, theÅ¿e three perÅ¿ons act in that which is common to them all, and wherein they are in one, and not wherein they are diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed, and are three; they act by the Å¿ame eÅ¿Å¿entiall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, as power, wiÅ¿dome, &amp;c. and theÅ¿e are one and the Å¿ame in them all, and Å¿o it is Gods work in Father, Son, and Holy GhoÅ¿t;

And the Father is no more diÅ¿covered then the Son, nor any one more then other, but God in all is diÅ¿covered. So that he is upon a miÅ¿take when he Å¿peaks of three principall Agents, that muÅ¿t be diÅ¿covered in the work of creation. For theÅ¿e perÅ¿ons that are, work but one thing, one being, one God, one reall Agent; for the very thing that the Father acts, the Son acts, and the Holy GhoÅ¿t acts, and the power is one, and the wiÅ¿dome is one, and the act is one.</p>
               <p>Or Å¿uppoÅ¿e it were granted, that there are three principall Agents, yet there are not three Agents eÅ¿Å¿entially diÅ¿tinct, but perÅ¿onally on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and Å¿o it comes all to one, whether one Å¿ay that there are three Agents, that may be called principall; or whether one Å¿ay, there is one principall Agent: for the one Agent is in three perÅ¿ons, and acts with Å¿ome perÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall diverÅ¿ity, and the three Agents are but one in eÅ¿Å¿ence, and but one thing, and act one thing, and by one power; therefore it is not materiall how it is expreÅ¿Å¿ed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Agent,</hi> as it relates. to God, may admit of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48559:35"/> the Å¿ame diÅ¿tinction as is made when we Å¿peak of God: <hi>Agent</hi> is conÅ¿idered either <hi>eÅ¿Å¿entially,</hi> or <hi>Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿tentially: EÅ¿Å¿entially,</hi> and then there is but one, as there is but one God. <hi>SubÅ¿iÅ¿ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially,</hi> and then there are three, as there are three PerÅ¿ons: But they do not differ really and eÅ¿Å¿entially one from another, as the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons do not; but onely in the manner of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Agent</hi> taken perÅ¿onally, though they Å¿hould be three, yet need not be diÅ¿covered each of them in the work, becauÅ¿e as they are eÅ¿Å¿entially one, Å¿o they work one individuall work by one individuall power, and force, and efficacy, which is numerically the Å¿ame, and therefore cannot leave a diÅ¿tinct impreÅ¿Å¿ion in any work.</p>
               <p>His Å¿econd Argument by which he would prove ChriÅ¿t to be but an inÅ¿trumental Agent in creating the world, is fetch'd from ReaÅ¿on: his words are theÅ¿e.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Å¿econd reaÅ¿on proceeds from the verdict of pure ReaÅ¿on: If ReaÅ¿on may obtain credit, Å¿he will tell us, that there could be in the work of Creation but one principall agent, becauÅ¿e there is by nature but one God; for if there were two principall agents, there muÅ¿t be two Gods, the terms being convertible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> 1. There is neither <hi>pure</hi> ReaÅ¿on nor <hi>cleer</hi> ReaÅ¿on to be found among men; and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48559:35"/> while he pleads Å¿o earneÅ¿tly for ReaÅ¿on, he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eth himÅ¿elf and the Truth in corrupted and darkened ReaÅ¿on, which he too much follows; and being in purÅ¿uit after ReaÅ¿on what it will preÅ¿ent, he turns aÅ¿ide from Scripture, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains not the knowledg of the Truth, which he would Å¿eem to contend for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> 2. He argues from plurality of Agents in the Creation, to plurality of Gods: which would have force and Å¿trength in it, if we held plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Agents really and eÅ¿Å¿entially diÅ¿tinct from one another: but if the Agent be one in eÅ¿Å¿ence, and perÅ¿onally onely more then one, (which is the doctrine we hold) no Å¿uch ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿urd conÅ¿equence will follow, that there Å¿hould be two or more Gods, becauÅ¿e there are two or more Agents perÅ¿onally (but not eÅ¿Å¿entially) differing from one another.</p>
               <p>3. His third ReaÅ¿on <hi>iÅ¿Å¿ues from the nature of ChriÅ¿ts being. ChriÅ¿t is the image of the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ible God, and Å¿o is diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed from God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e the image and the thing whereof it is an image is not the Å¿ame, in that nothing can be the image of it Å¿elf.</hi> Col. 1. 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> Where it is Å¿aid, that ChriÅ¿t is the <hi>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God,</hi> God is there taken Synechdochi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, or perÅ¿onally for the <hi>Father,</hi> as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if you compare it with <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. where he is called <hi>the expreÅ¿s image of his Fathers perÅ¿on.</hi> Now ChriÅ¿t may be the image of the Father,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48559:36"/> and yet not the image of himÅ¿elf; for though God, taken eÅ¿Å¿entially, do not differ from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe, and therefore he cannot in that Å¿enÅ¿e be the image of God, and be God himÅ¿elf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e he Å¿hould then be the image of himÅ¿elf; yet God taken perÅ¿onally for the Father, may differ from himÅ¿elf, taken perÅ¿onally for the Son; that is, one perÅ¿on may, doth differ from another, and one may be the image of another, the Son of the Father; and may in that Å¿enÅ¿e be the image of God, and yet not of himÅ¿elf, though he be God.</p>
               <p>But he renders a reaÅ¿on why ChriÅ¿t is called the image of God. <hi>BecauÅ¿e</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>God did manifeÅ¿t his divine glory and dominion over the creature through him chiefly, for which reaÅ¿on alÅ¿o man is called the image and glory of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> ChriÅ¿t according to his manhood may be called the image of God, becauÅ¿e of that glory and dominion that he was lifted up to, for he was made head of all principality and power; but he was the image of God in an higher way alÅ¿o: <hi>viz. as he was a Son, Heb.</hi> 1. 2. 3. which SonÅ¿hip was before this colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted LordÅ¿hip, which he had; for he was a Son before there was any creature to rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as himÅ¿elf hath confeÅ¿Å¿ed; and if a Son, then the image of his Father: but this was diÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿ed in my former Treat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>Å¿e<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> therefore
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48559:36"/> I might have paÅ¿Å¿ed it over in Å¿ilence.</p>
               <p>He Å¿aith further, that <hi>ChriÅ¿t is called the firÅ¿t-born of every creature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> The urging and the anÅ¿wering of this is but to weary the Reader with frivolous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions; therefore I referre him to what hath been repreÅ¿ented already, both in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and in this preÅ¿ent TreatiÅ¿e, concerning this Title, <hi>FirÅ¿t-born of every creature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude, The force of this argument lies in this; whole ChriÅ¿t is a creature, and therefore but an inÅ¿trumental Agent, &amp; to prove the Antecedent, he produceth, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 15. produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced before. He might have cited &amp; rehearÅ¿ed all thoÅ¿e Arguments, &amp; Scriptures of his which he brought before, &amp; wherewith he filled many pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as aptly &amp; fitly as he hath mentioned theÅ¿e, but with little profit or delight to the Reader.</p>
               <p>I Å¿hall conclude my anÅ¿wer to this argument, that when ever he Å¿hall be able to prove ChriÅ¿t to be a creature, I will yeild him to be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trumentall Agent. But then it muÅ¿t be done with repetitions.</p>
               <p>I now come to anÅ¿wer his fourth reaÅ¿on, which (he Å¿aith) <hi>doth Å¿pring from the manner of ChriÅ¿t's working, Å¿aith he, though ChriÅ¿t had an hand in the Creation of the world, yet was it not originally of him.</hi> 1 Cor. 8. 6. <hi>All things are of the Father, but not of, but by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us ChriÅ¿t; the Father is made the firÅ¿t cauÅ¿e,</hi>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:48559:37"/> 
                  <hi>and originall of all things, and ChriÅ¿t the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trument of the Father,</hi> 2. <hi>In that it is Å¿aid in Scripture, that God acted by him in the work of creation,</hi> EpheÅ¿. 3. 9. <hi>where it is Å¿aid, that God created all things by JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t,</hi> Å¿o in Heb. 1. 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> I find no new Å¿trength of argument here, but what I have met with before, &amp; have largely anÅ¿wered before, in that former TreatiÅ¿e of mine; to which I referre the Reader; for I am aÅ¿hamed to follow him in his cauÅ¿leÅ¿Å¿e iterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and repetitions, yet I Å¿hall add Å¿omething to what I have repreÅ¿ented, Å¿eeing he gives me an occaÅ¿ion.</p>
               <p>As there is a diÅ¿tinct order of Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿ting, Å¿o there is a diÅ¿tinct order of working. And the divine eÅ¿Å¿ence Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿ting in three perÅ¿ons, theÅ¿e perÅ¿ons work in three diÅ¿tinct manners; the Son being begotten of the Father, worketh from the Father, <hi>The Son can do nothing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf, but what he Å¿eeth the Father do,</hi> John 5. 19. And the Father begetting the Son, worketh by the Son, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 16. 20. and in very many more places. So the Holy GhoÅ¿t proceeding from the Father, and from the Son, worketh from them both, in <hi>John</hi> 16. 13. <hi>He Å¿hall not Å¿peak of himÅ¿elfe, but as he hears Å¿o Å¿hall he Å¿peak, and he Å¿hall take of mine, and Å¿hew unto you;</hi> yet neither the Son, nor the Holy GhoÅ¿t do work as inÅ¿truments.</p>
               <p>The Son doth not, for that is the Å¿ubject in hand
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48559:37"/> to be diÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿ed, nor doth the Greek particle <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                  </gap>, (which is here tranÅ¿lated <hi>by)</hi> Å¿hew Å¿o much; for it is prefixed to the works of the Father, as well as to the works of the Son, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Paul an ApoÅ¿tle, not of men, nor by men, but by JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, and God the Father.</hi> Here we may obÅ¿erve three things, 1. That theÅ¿e particles, or prepoÅ¿itions are not always di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tinguiÅ¿hing particles, putting difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt thing and thing, to which they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed; but they many times are promiÅ¿cuouÅ¿ly uÅ¿ed, and are confounded; for <hi>[of</hi> and <hi>by</hi>] applied to men, do import the Å¿ame thing. 2. The particle <hi>by,</hi> doth not declare the perÅ¿on to whom it is applied to be an inÅ¿trument; for it is applied to the Father equally as to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us ChriÅ¿t. But he will not aÅ¿Å¿ert the Father to be an inÅ¿trument. 3. That whereas the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son are mentioned together, they are made equall in manner of working, and they are either both inÅ¿truments, or both prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Agents, and Efficients; for <hi>Paul</hi> was an ApoÅ¿tle by JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, and by God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t hath the leading place. In <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 36. <hi>For of him, and by him, and to him are all things.</hi> Here the particle <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                  </gap>, which is tranÅ¿lated <hi>by,</hi> or <hi>through,</hi> is attributed to God, and he will Å¿ay, that the Father is meant, and only the Father; and we may obÅ¿erve two things. 1. According to the truth of the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48559:38"/> thing, the particles <hi>of</hi> and <hi>by</hi> are all one; and that <hi>by</hi> doth not import any inÅ¿trumentalneÅ¿s; for God in no Å¿enÅ¿e can be an inÅ¿trument. 2. According to the Å¿enÅ¿e that he puts upon the particle <hi>by,</hi> God is both the principall Agent, becauÅ¿e <hi>of him are all things:</hi> and he is alÅ¿o the InÅ¿trument of all things, for <hi>by him are all things.</hi> AlÅ¿o in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 10. where the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is Å¿poken of and attributed to the Father, and not to the Son, it is not attributed to him as Å¿omething <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                  </gap>, but as Å¿omthing <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                  </gap>, not as <hi>of him,</hi> but as <hi>by him:</hi> The words are theÅ¿e, <hi>It behoved him for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, to make the Prince and Captain,</hi> &amp;c. Yet he will not Å¿ay that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is an InÅ¿trument. I Å¿hall not multiply places, theÅ¿e Texts are Å¿ufficient to Å¿hew the abÅ¿urdity and falÅ¿eneÅ¿s of the gloÅ¿s that he puts upon the prepoÅ¿itions <hi>[of]</hi> and <hi>[by].</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which he aÅ¿Å¿erts of the Fathers, that they frequently call him Gods inÅ¿trument, and Å¿ervant, is true of ChriÅ¿t as the Å¿on of man, according to his humane nature; and they call him no other then the Prophet, <hi>IÅ¿a.</hi> 42. 1. which muÅ¿t he Å¿o underÅ¿tood.</p>
               <p>In the next place, after his Arguments, where he placed his own Å¿trength for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of ChriÅ¿ts inÅ¿trumentalneÅ¿s in <hi>Creation,</hi> he comes to conÅ¿ider my Argument againÅ¿t it, which was this:</p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:48559:38"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>God could not make uÅ¿e of an instrument in the work of creating of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this he anÅ¿wers, 1. <hi>This AÅ¿Å¿ertion derogates from Gods al-Å¿ufficiency: Is any thing impoÅ¿Å¿ible with God? is any thing too hard for the Lord?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> This AÅ¿Å¿ertion, as it is laid down, with a reaÅ¿on to explain it, is Å¿o far from derogating from Gods al-Å¿ufficiency, that it is the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of Gods al-Å¿ufficiency: there is Å¿uch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity of perfection in Gods al-Å¿ufficiency, that it is incommunicable to the creature: God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make another as Å¿ufficient as himÅ¿elf; that is, It is Å¿o tranÅ¿cendently excellent, that no creature is capable of it. And whereas he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, Is any thing too hard for God? Is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing impoÅ¿Å¿ible to the Lord? he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this anÅ¿wer, What-ever may be done by power, God can do it, becauÅ¿e he hath Å¿uffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of power in himÅ¿elf to do it: But that which cannot be done in the nature of the thing, which implyes a contradiction if it were Å¿uppoÅ¿ed to be done, that is impoÅ¿Å¿ible with God, or in it Å¿elf rather: as, It is impoÅ¿Å¿ible for the moÅ¿t high God to make a God moÅ¿t high, becauÅ¿e God moÅ¿t high hath his being of himÅ¿elf, and is uncreated and eternall, and gives being to other things. Therefore a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted moÅ¿t high God carries a contradiction with it, therefore is a thing not to be done, and God cannot do it; yet it argues not any
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48559:39"/> weakneÅ¿s in God becauÅ¿e he cannot do it.</p>
               <p>2. He Å¿aith I contradict my own teÅ¿timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and he minds me of the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I remember</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>that in a Conference (where I exerciÅ¿ed both Å¿ilence and patience, to the glory of God) Å¿ince I received your paper, you did affirm (in the hearing of not a few) that God might have made an Angel, or Å¿ome other creature at the firÅ¿t, and by it have made all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> I do remember that time he Å¿peaks of, and Å¿o do Å¿ome Å¿cores of perÅ¿ons as well as I, &amp; will remember it while they live, wherein he exerciÅ¿ed not Å¿ilence altogether, for he Å¿pake at the laÅ¿t in the cloÅ¿e of the conference, &amp; it had been better he had been Å¿ilent, then to Å¿peak as he did, for he aÅ¿Å¿erted an untruth in thoÅ¿e few words he did Å¿peak: he uttered words to this purpoÅ¿e, That it was Å¿trange to him, that he Å¿hould be brought upon the Å¿tage in Å¿o publick a way, for holding Å¿uch an opinion, when he had not declared himÅ¿elf in a poÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive way at any time about it: Which cauÅ¿ed me to mind him of his firÅ¿t Sermon in which he broached his opinion in a poÅ¿itive way, in this aÅ¿Å¿ertion, <hi>That Christ is not the ultimate and last rest of Saints, but the Father; and that Christ was but the way to it.</hi> Which, if ChriÅ¿t be coeÅ¿Å¿entiall with the Father, is falÅ¿e; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his aÅ¿Å¿ertion did deny by an undenyable
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48559:39"/> conÅ¿equence the coeÅ¿Å¿entiality of ChriÅ¿t with the Father. And at another time he publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his preaching Å¿peaking his opinion on <hi>John</hi> 3. 13. <hi>No man hath aÅ¿cended up into heaven but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven,</hi> Å¿aid, that he could not conceive how ChriÅ¿t being at that time on earth, could be in heaven, unleÅ¿Å¿e it were in reÅ¿pect of that knowledg which he had of the Father, and the things of heaven: or words to this effect. In which he denyed the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿ence of ChriÅ¿t, and conÅ¿equently the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of ChriÅ¿t: And yet in that Å¿hort Å¿peech of his he would make fair weather of it, and put a face upon it, as if he were not the man he was taken for.</p>
               <p>Concerning his <hi>patience,</hi> not I alone, but many others did judge it Å¿tupidity rather then patience; for Å¿carce any one that had had the Å¿pirit of a man, could have been dumb, and not open his mouth, when he was Å¿o palpably called forth to appear in the cauÅ¿e. It did cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Å¿trike amazement in very many, that knew he was there, and yet could not hear him Å¿peak one word, having Å¿o many Å¿trong invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereto; Or if it were not Å¿tupidity, it was cunning craftineÅ¿s; for he knew how to make advantage by being here and keeping Å¿ilence, and he could reÅ¿erve himÅ¿elf in point of Å¿pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to a more hopefull time, and fairer op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48559:40"/> in which he might by Å¿peaking propagate his opinion; there was little hope of advantaging his cauÅ¿e at that time, when there were Å¿o many to contradict him. And yet he might feele mens pulÅ¿es by being there, and diÅ¿cern who were his friends, and who his enemies, and who might probably be wrought upon, and who not.</p>
               <p>But (he Å¿aith) <hi>it was to the glory of God, that he exerciÅ¿ed Å¿ilence and patience.</hi> But it was every to way the diÅ¿honor of God, for if truth were in his tenent, then he Å¿hamefully deÅ¿erted it, when he Å¿hould have committed himÅ¿elf to God in the maintaining of it, who ever oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed it. And if Errour and HereÅ¿ie were in his tenent, then he carried it craftily to do the more miÅ¿chiefe, for he thought it wiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to forbear when it might be much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ed, and to take time to Å¿peak, when it might be more prevalent, that he might draw away the more DiÅ¿ciples after him.</p>
               <p>But he tells me of a contradiction. Where lies it? In theÅ¿e words, <hi>God could make uÅ¿e of no InÅ¿trument in the worke of creation; and God might have made uÅ¿e of an Angel, or Å¿ome other creature, and by it have made all things.</hi> Here is a contradiction indeed, if theÅ¿e aÅ¿Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be taken Å¿eparately, from other expre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ions that expounded them. And here lies the injury that he doth me, which an unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48559:40"/> perÅ¿on, and Å¿tander by betwixt us, upon his firÅ¿t reading of this charge which he makes againÅ¿t me, of contradiction, (who was preÅ¿ent at the conference) Å¿oone diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and expreÅ¿Å¿ed himÅ¿elfe to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e, <hi>That he Å¿hould thinke the worÅ¿e of Mr.</hi> Knowles <hi>while he knew him, for the wrong he did me in this matter.</hi> He leaves out thoÅ¿e words which cleared it from contradiction; When I Å¿aid, <hi>God could uÅ¿e no inÅ¿trument in the worke of creation,</hi> I Å¿poke of Å¿uch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trument by whoÅ¿e force, and vertue, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Å¿uch a worke might be affected, as my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter words clearly Å¿hew; <hi>becauÅ¿e creation is the making of things out of nothing, and required an infinite power, which no creature is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, for it would make him a God.</hi> TheÅ¿e words do demonÅ¿trate that I Å¿pake of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trument that might be co-operative with God in vertue and efficacy in Å¿o great a worke. But when I Å¿pake of <hi>an Angell as an InÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which God might have made uÅ¿e of in the creation of the world, if he would,</hi> I both meant it, and expreÅ¿Å¿ed it of Å¿uch a kind of InÅ¿trument which contributes no vertue nor efficacy to the worke, but is a means without which God will not do Å¿uch a worke, rather then a means by which he will do it; Å¿uch as the blowing with rams horns was for the bringing downe of the walls
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48559:41"/> of <hi>Jericho,</hi> in which there was no vertue for the effecting of Å¿uch a worke, and Å¿o God might have made an Angell, and might have Å¿aid to it, Go, Å¿ay, Let there be Heavens and earth, and at the Angels Å¿peaking, it might have been; not becauÅ¿e there was any vertue in the Angels Å¿peaking for the production of Å¿uch things; but the vertue is wholly Gods. But it is otherwiÅ¿e with ChriÅ¿t in his making of the World, the vertue is his owne, ChriÅ¿t is Å¿aid to <hi>Å¿upport al things by the word of his own power,</hi> and Å¿o by conÅ¿equence to create all things by the word of his owne power. Now Å¿uch an InÅ¿trument ChriÅ¿t could not be, nor any creature, nor could any creature be capable of any Å¿uch power: and thus I expreÅ¿Å¿ed it upon that day of conference, as there are many witneÅ¿Å¿es. And yet thus he abuÅ¿eth me, and then gloryes over me in a large man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and triumphs exceÅ¿Å¿ively. His words are theÅ¿e:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How to reconcile one with another is unfea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ible, you muÅ¿t confeÅ¿s you are not alwayes infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, you Å¿ometimes differ from your Å¿elfe, and then no wonder if you diÅ¿agree with others. What Å¿hall I take for your judgment,</hi> &amp;c?</p>
               <p>And thus he goes on in a vapouring way, with a deal of Å¿tuff Å¿uch as this, and his glorying over me in this, (Å¿eeing I am innocent where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he accuÅ¿eth me) is not my Å¿hame, but his.</p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:48559:41"/>
               <p> Afterwards, when he had teÅ¿tified his high eÅ¿timation of reaÅ¿on in Å¿ome hyperbolicall, or rather phantaÅ¿ticall expreÅ¿Å¿ions, <hi>as proÅ¿tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himÅ¿elfe to the Å¿hadow of it, rather then to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mans teÅ¿timony,</hi> (if he had Å¿poken Å¿o much of Scripture, I Å¿hould have liked it better) he examines my reaÅ¿on, why God could make uÅ¿e of no InÅ¿trument in creation of the world.</p>
               <p>My reaÅ¿on was this, Creation is a making all things out of nothing, and requires an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite power, which God cannot derive to any creature; and therefore he cannot make uÅ¿e of any InÅ¿trument in creating.</p>
               <p>His firÅ¿t anÅ¿wer that he gives is this, <hi>That Gods infinite power was manifeÅ¿ted in the worke of creation, yet was not the infinity of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er manifeÅ¿ted fully in that, or any other worke; for he hath more power then ever yet he had need to uÅ¿e, or then could in any worke be fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> In this anÅ¿wer there Å¿eems to be 1. <hi>abÅ¿urdity,</hi> 2. <hi>Impertinency,</hi> 3. <hi>EvaÅ¿ion.</hi> The <hi>abÅ¿urdity</hi> is in this, there is a diÅ¿tinction put without a difference appearing: he would make infinite power manifeÅ¿ted, and infinity of power manifeÅ¿ted, to be two things, and yet they are the Å¿ame thing; for infinite power and infinity of power are both one thing, and infinite power manifeÅ¿ted, and infinity of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48559:42"/> power manifeÅ¿ted muÅ¿t conÅ¿equently be one thing alÅ¿o. The <hi>impertinence</hi> lies in this; My Argument runs of one thing, his anÅ¿wer is to another thing; I Å¿peake of infinite power derived to the creature, and Å¿ay the creature is not capable of it; he tels me of infinite power manifeÅ¿ted, and Å¿o Å¿peaks not to the purpoÅ¿e. The <hi>evaÅ¿ion</hi> appears in this, he Å¿aith that the infinity of Gods power was not manifeÅ¿ted fully in that work of creation, or in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but what of this? If it was not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifeÅ¿ted, yet was it not truely mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿ted? Å¿o as that the rationall creature might be able to Å¿ay, the power that was put forth in making Å¿uch creatures of nothing, is infinite, no leÅ¿s then the power of the moÅ¿t high God? as Å¿ometimes the Magicians of <hi>Egypt</hi> Å¿aid, this is the finger of God, the power of God, which tranÅ¿cends the power that any creature is capable of. And if infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite power was truly manifeÅ¿ted, how is the Argument enervated, or wherein invalidated? And if infinity of power be not fully manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ted, what is the reaÅ¿on of it? Doth it not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a contradiction in the Å¿enÅ¿e in which he intends it? For to aÅ¿Å¿ert that infinity of power is in Å¿uch Å¿ort manifeÅ¿ted in any work, as that he cannot further manifeÅ¿t it, but hath wrought to the utmoÅ¿t of his power, and can proceed no further, neither hath any more to uÅ¿e, is
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48559:42"/> to deny infinity of power to be in God; and there is a contradiction in it <hi>in adjecto,</hi> a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction implied; and Å¿uch a manifeÅ¿tation would rather be an exhauÅ¿tion of power, which is impoÅ¿Å¿ible where infinite power is.</p>
               <p>His expreÅ¿Å¿ions of more power in thoÅ¿e words of his, <hi>he hath more power then ever yet he had need to uÅ¿e,</hi> have truth in them in a Å¿enÅ¿e, but in an other Å¿enÅ¿e have fraud and falÅ¿hood in them; if he mean by more power, more of the Å¿ame kind then ever yet he had need to uÅ¿e, it will be granted to him, without any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to him; for if God could Å¿pend his Å¿tore, he could not be Å¿aid to be infinite in power. It is certain, that God hath an inexhauÅ¿table treaÅ¿ure of power, and the more he manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿teth of it, he hath not the leÅ¿s to manifeÅ¿t, but can declare it millions of waies in which he hath not yet declared it; and there may be yet more glorious effects of it if he Å¿hall pleaÅ¿e, then any that have been wrought. But this conceÅ¿Å¿ion hurts not my aÅ¿Å¿ertion, viz <hi>that an infinite power is required in creation;</hi> and he hath not denyed the truth and clearneÅ¿s of the manifeÅ¿tation of it therein, though he Å¿ay there may by a fuller manifeÅ¿tation of it, which by the multiplication of mighty works which God can effect, muÅ¿t needs be; becauÅ¿e every work will bear witneÅ¿s thereof in reference to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48559:43"/> it Å¿elf. But if he Å¿hould mean by <hi>more power</hi> a greater power, or more in meaÅ¿ure, and degree then yet he hath uÅ¿ed and manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ted in the creation, and in the works which he hath wrought, it muÅ¿t not be yeilded to him; for though there might be a greater work, yet not a greater power, for the Å¿ame power is manifeÅ¿ted in the one as in the other, <hi>viz.</hi> an infinite power, and there are no degrees in that which is infinite; though one worke may more fully Å¿peak to us that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity of power which is put forth therein then an other doth.</p>
               <p>The work of creation is that work that God glories in in the Scripture, and he doth appropriate it to himÅ¿elf, and doth give witneÅ¿s therein to the world, that he is the moÅ¿t high God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. 10, 11, 12. <hi>And the inviÅ¿ible things of him from the creation of the world are cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Å¿een, being underÅ¿tood by the the things that are made, even his eternall power and Godhead, Å¿o that the very heathen are left without excuÅ¿e,</hi> Rom. 1. 20.</p>
               <p>And a greater work then creation is, from which an ampler teÅ¿timony of the infinity of Gods power may be fetched for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the creature, in Å¿ome Å¿enÅ¿e there can be none; for there is an infinite diÅ¿tance betwixt Å¿omething and nothing, and onely an infinite power can get over it: for that which
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48559:43"/> cannot be meaÅ¿ured is infinite, but the diÅ¿tance betwixt Å¿omething and nothing is Å¿uch as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be meaÅ¿ured; and creation is a bringing of Å¿omething out of nothing, therefore the power that effects it muÅ¿t be infinite: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore infinite power or infinity of power is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeÅ¿ted in great fulneÅ¿Å¿e and cleareneÅ¿Å¿e in creation.</p>
               <p>His 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. anÅ¿wer that he gives is this,</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Your aÅ¿Å¿ertion plainly denyes the man ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us to be God Almighty, or infinite in power; for you Å¿ay, that God could not give or derive an infinite power to any creature, and that a creature cannot be God Almighty, &amp;c. The man ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us was a creature, How then can that perÅ¿on be God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> This reaÅ¿oning is unworthy a man of parts; a very child that hath learned the firÅ¿t principles, might anÅ¿wer him. The man ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us is a creature; that is, the Å¿on of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> the Å¿eed of <hi>Abraham</hi> is a creature; and I do deny this Å¿eed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as the Å¿eed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to be God, or Almighty, or capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of an infinite power, and therfore God could not derive it, nor was ChriÅ¿t Almighty as man, as the Å¿on of man; But this man ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us was God, as well as man, that is, this perÅ¿on ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us, was both God and man; not that the manhood was turned into the Godhead, and Å¿o became God, but that the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48559:44"/> eternall Son of God, who is by nature God, with the Father, and the Holy GhoÅ¿t, aÅ¿Å¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med manhood, tooke the nature of man, the Å¿eed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and became one perÅ¿on with it, and this perÅ¿on was Almighty, as he was the Son of God, not as man; and this almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineÅ¿Å¿e was not by derivation from the Father, but was an eÅ¿Å¿entiall attribute in him.</p>
               <p>His third Argument is this,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Ground (Å¿aith he) of your Argument is Å¿traw and Å¿tubble; for infinite power may be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeÅ¿ted by them to whom 'tis not communicated. And he gives inÅ¿tances many.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> BecauÅ¿e I Å¿oreÅ¿aw he might give Å¿uch an anÅ¿wer, therefore on that day of the conference, which he Å¿poke of, I mentioned Å¿uch an inÅ¿trument which he now Å¿peaks of, which is not the Å¿ubject of the power, but a meanes without which God will not exerciÅ¿e the power which he himÅ¿elfe is the Å¿ubject of: and I granted, God might have made uÅ¿e of Å¿uch an inÅ¿trument, but ChriÅ¿t in creation (as alÅ¿o in preÅ¿ervation) is the Å¿ubject of the power, and I Å¿poke of Å¿uch an inÅ¿trument which is the Å¿ubject of power, and Å¿hewed it was impoÅ¿Å¿ible that there Å¿hould be Å¿uch an inÅ¿trument, and therefore ChriÅ¿t having Å¿uch power in himÅ¿elfe could not be an inÅ¿trumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, but the principall Agent.</p>
               <p>He comes in the laÅ¿t place to conÅ¿ider of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48559:44"/> the Minor of the Argument, which he had caÅ¿t the Scriptures I produced into, fetched from ChriÅ¿ts creating, which is this: <hi>All things were made by ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His anÅ¿wer is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is true, ChriÅ¿t being excepted, of whoÅ¿e creaturall being</hi> I have already Å¿poken.</p>
               <p>But againÅ¿t this anÅ¿wer he frames an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>You will Å¿ay</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>that in Joh.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>it is Å¿aid, that without him was nothing made that was made.</hi> And he anÅ¿wers it,</p>
               <p>Sol. <hi>The words are to be restrained to all thoÅ¿e things which by the uÅ¿e of an instrument were made; in the firÅ¿t verÅ¿e the creation of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us ChriÅ¿t is included, and in this</hi> 3 <hi>verÅ¿e he is Å¿poken of as the inÅ¿trument of God in creating all things; therefore he is there to be excepted.</hi> And he gives Å¿ome inÅ¿tances, which I omit the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of, becauÅ¿e I Å¿hall have no need to return anÅ¿wer to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> If indeed the creation of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t be included in <hi>ver.</hi> 1. then I Å¿hall grant that JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t is excepted in <hi>ver.</hi> 3. but if not, then <hi>ver.</hi> 3. is Å¿trong againÅ¿t him. The words in <hi>ver</hi> 1. <hi>In the beginning was the word,</hi> and that is granted by both Å¿ides, that then he <hi>was;</hi> but that then he <hi>began</hi> is not aÅ¿Å¿erted by the ApoÅ¿tle and is denyed by us: if he will have it to be Å¿o, let him Å¿hew in his next how he
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48559:45"/> will fetch out creation from theÅ¿e words, <hi>In the beginning was the word.</hi> God the Father was in the beginning; was God the Father therefore created in the beginning?</p>

            <div type="part">
               <p>The next Scripture produced by me to prove ChriÅ¿t's Deity by, was <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 3. <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out father, without mother, without deÅ¿cent, having neither beginning of dayes, nor end of life, made like unto the Son of God, abideth a PrieÅ¿t continually.</hi> ChriÅ¿t is here reÅ¿embled to <hi>MelchiÅ¿edech,</hi> in reference to eternity.

So our High PrieÅ¿t JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t is without beginning of dayes, or end of life</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> This anÅ¿wer is too light and frothy in a Å¿ubject Å¿o Å¿erious; It was not mine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent or deÅ¿igne, (and he knows it very well) to make <hi>MelchiÅ¿edech</hi> God, nor any of the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48559:45"/> perÅ¿ons of the Godhead, nor yet to make a quaternity of perÅ¿ons, but to make ChriÅ¿t God, to whom that in truth belongs, which in type only, and in a figure, myÅ¿tically is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to <hi>MelchiÅ¿edech. MoÅ¿es</hi> and <hi>David</hi> Å¿peak of <hi>MelchiÅ¿edech,</hi> as if he had been one who had glided down out of heaven, and come from above, and had again Å¿oon after conveyed himÅ¿elf thither; for there is not any mention at all made of his birth, or death, of his father, or mother, or kindred, or when he became PrieÅ¿t, nor when he laid down his PrieÅ¿thood. And the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿aw the myÅ¿terie in it, and that it behoved him Å¿o to be deÅ¿cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and Å¿et out, that he might be a Type of ChriÅ¿t, both of his PerÅ¿on, and PrieÅ¿thood. And therefore when he makes uÅ¿e of him as a Type to Å¿et out ChriÅ¿t by, he deÅ¿cribes him to be without father, and Å¿o was ChriÅ¿t as he was man; and without mother, and Å¿o was ChriÅ¿t as he was God, having no beginning of dayes, nor end of life; nor had ChriÅ¿t (according to his divine Nature conÅ¿idered) either beginning, or end of dayes; but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ording to his humane, he had both, and both of them deÅ¿cribed, and well known by all that are verÅ¿ed in Scripture-Å¿tory; and the ApoÅ¿tle knowing theÅ¿e things, in expreÅ¿Å¿e words makes <hi>MelchiÅ¿edech</hi> the Type of him, diÅ¿cerning, that the Holy GhoÅ¿t (in concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48559:46"/> theÅ¿e things of him) had made him Å¿o, and intended him to be Å¿o, as theÅ¿e words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, <hi>Made like unto the Son of God, for he is deÅ¿cribed</hi> (Å¿aith <hi>Beza) as if he had neither been mortall man, nor had been born of a mortall woman; which becauÅ¿e it could by no means a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with any meer man born of men; therefore the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿aith, that he is peculiarly the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of that one only begotten Son of God, and that it was Å¿o intended by the Holy GhoÅ¿t.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now then the Å¿trength of the Argument fetch'd from this Scripture, lies here, FirÅ¿t, <hi>MelchiÅ¿edech</hi> is a Type of ChriÅ¿t; that is without controverÅ¿ie. Secondly, He is a Type in theÅ¿e things mentioned of him, <hi>Without father, without mother, without beginning of dayes, and end of time.</hi> OtherwiÅ¿e in vain doth the ApoÅ¿tle mention theÅ¿e things of <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿edech,</hi> but as a type; for in truth, it was not Å¿o of <hi>MelchiÅ¿edech.</hi> And it appears by the Å¿cope of the ApoÅ¿tle, which was to interpret the words of <hi>David, A PrieÅ¿t after the order of MelchiÅ¿edech;</hi> therefore it was neceÅ¿Å¿ary for him to Å¿et forth what <hi>MelchiÅ¿edech</hi> was in his perÅ¿on, and in his office; and in his perÅ¿on he was <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>Without father, without mother,</hi> not in truth; but they are not mentioned, and Å¿o it is, as if it had been Å¿o, and that in type he might be Å¿o, and therein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿emble the Son of God, that in truth was Å¿o.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48559:46"/> Thirdly, <hi>MelchiÅ¿edech</hi> (being only a type in theÅ¿e things of ChriÅ¿t) it was not neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ary that he Å¿hould be Å¿uch in truth, but only in a figure, myÅ¿tically, as indeed he was not; but it was neceÅ¿Å¿ary, that ChriÅ¿t Å¿hould be Å¿o in truth, being the Anti-type, that is, being the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of that which <hi>MelchiÅ¿edech</hi> was but a Å¿hadow of; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in <hi>John</hi> 1. 17. it is Å¿aid, that <hi>the law was given by MoÅ¿es, but grace and truth came by JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t.</hi> That is, there were many Å¿hadows in the law of <hi>MoÅ¿es,</hi> but ChriÅ¿t came and fulfilled them, and was the truth of them. We read of <hi>David,</hi> that he Å¿aid of himÅ¿elfe, <hi>They pierced my hands and my feet, they gave me vineger and gall to drink;</hi> which really were not done to <hi>David,</hi> but my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tically, and in a figure, as <hi>David</hi> was the type of ChriÅ¿t; but theÅ¿e things were really done to ChriÅ¿t, and in truth were fulfilled in ChriÅ¿t. So the bloud of buls and calves and of Å¿uch beaÅ¿ts which were Å¿acrificed, and offered, they took away Å¿in, cleanÅ¿ed away the guilt, and brought pardon, and purged the conÅ¿cience, and brought peace; but none of theÅ¿e did Å¿o in truth, but myÅ¿tically, in type only, as they Å¿hadowed out, and pointed at the Å¿acrifice of ChriÅ¿t, and at his bloud: but the bloud of ChriÅ¿t really and in truth did take away Å¿in, did clenÅ¿e the conÅ¿cience, did bring remiÅ¿Å¿ion &amp; peace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 9, 12, 13, 14.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48559:47"/> More inÅ¿tances might be given, but indeed there is evidence enough in the very nature of a type, and antitype. There is a myÅ¿tery in the type, and there is the impletion or fulfilling of the myÅ¿tery in the Antitype, or the thing of the myÅ¿tery, is to be Å¿een in the Antitype.

ChriÅ¿t the wiÅ¿dome of God, declares, how he was poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed, <hi>viz.</hi> as a <hi>Son</hi> that is brought forth by a woman travelling; in which ChriÅ¿t is Å¿aid to be born, and is called the firÅ¿t-born, to exclude creation, and that it might be by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; and the act of the Father in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating the divine eÅ¿Å¿ence to the Son, is called (after the manner of men, that it may be better conceived of) a begetting, or generating, Å¿ute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to which is the Hebrew word <hi>Amun, v.</hi> 30. w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> Å¿ignifies a child nurÅ¿ed, nouriÅ¿hed, brought up with a father, and Å¿uch was ChriÅ¿t; which is thus expreÅ¿Å¿ed, to hold forth his generation, and not creation; for when God created <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> he created him a man; but ChriÅ¿t is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ented as a child, to Å¿hew how he was begotten: and it is added, that ChriÅ¿t was his Fathers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and a Å¿port before him, (for Å¿o it is in the Hebrew) and this is <hi>humanitÃ¹s dictum,</hi> is is Å¿poken after the manner of Fathers, who take dear delight in the childe that comes out of their owne bowels; and when it is little, it is very pleaÅ¿ant, and makes the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Å¿port; and by it is Å¿ignified to us, what an one ChriÅ¿t was, what a Å¿on he was, that he was his owne proper Å¿on, not created but ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated; having his very eÅ¿Å¿ence from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48559:48"/> by an act of eternall generation, and in whom God taketh delight, after the manner of parents in a child that comes out of their bowells, and is a part of themÅ¿elves, that is, the higheÅ¿t &amp; deareÅ¿t delight, and the moÅ¿t natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and intimate delight, beyond which there neither is or can be any delight. It is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿t therefore that he confounds things that muÅ¿t not be confounded, he would have poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ing or obtaining to be one with creating in this place, but it is a groÅ¿s miÅ¿take in him.</p>
               <p>But when was it that God did thus poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿s or beget ChriÅ¿t? He would have it to be <hi>when God began to work; then God created ChriÅ¿t</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>before his works of old.</hi> But it is manifeÅ¿t, that the very words, that Å¿et forth Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity are uÅ¿ed here.

And though it be Å¿aid, <hi>in the beginning of his way,</hi> yet this makes nothing againÅ¿t ChriÅ¿ts
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48559:48"/> eternity, becauÅ¿e it is added, that it was before his works; Å¿o that this <hi>[was]</hi> points at eternity: for who will aÅ¿Å¿ert that creation was the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Gods way? did God act nothing before he created? it is undoubtedly falÅ¿e. So that again he is to blame to confound <hi>beginning</hi> (as he underÅ¿tands beginning) and <hi>everlaÅ¿ting,</hi> as if they were one, when as they differ as much as <hi>eternity</hi> and <hi>time</hi> do differ.</p>
               <p>But he preÅ¿ents us with the Septuagint ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion; but it is not at hand, and I dare not take his word without viewing it, he hath Å¿o often deceived me in his quotations. Then he gives in <hi>Montanus</hi> his verÅ¿ion; but that is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t my aÅ¿Å¿ertion, nor doth it favour his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.

               <p>I grant that the word is rendred a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, in <hi>Levit.</hi> 6. 2. and <hi>proximus</hi> is Engli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hed a neighbour, and therefore I accord with <hi>Tremelius,</hi> who Å¿aith, the Hebrew word doth Å¿ound as much as <hi>proximus,</hi> a neighbour; and we know who is mans neighbour, one of the Å¿ame kind, a man like himÅ¿elfe, and in that reÅ¿pect his fellow, his equall. But who is this Lord of HoaÅ¿ts neighbour? any meere man conÅ¿iÅ¿ting onely of Å¿oul and body? Then God and man have one and the Å¿ame neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: but it is little leÅ¿s then blaÅ¿phemy to Å¿ay, that any creature is Gods neighbour; no, it is a perÅ¿on of the Å¿ame nature and eÅ¿Å¿ence
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48559:51"/> that is his neighbour, the eternall Son of God is the Fathers neighbour, was nigh him and by him from Eternity.

               <p>But he makes two collections from the Å¿ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the word,</p>
               <p>1. Saith he, <hi>Christ is the principall object of Gods deareÅ¿t love: The man my fellow whom I moÅ¿t love, Å¿aith</hi> Grotius.</p>

                  <hi>Repl.</hi> This will be readily granted, and the other <hi>viz.</hi> coequallity not impedited nor gainÅ¿aid by it, for the Father loves his coequall better then all others; and becauÅ¿e he is of the Å¿ame nature, and therein coequall, therfore he loves him beÅ¿t.</p>
               <p>2. Saith he, <hi>ChriÅ¿t is Gods principall Å¿ervant in his high tranÅ¿actions, one that is Gods repreÅ¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> That ChriÅ¿t according to his humane nature is Gods Å¿ervant, is granted; but that it may be collected from this place of <hi>Zachery</hi> that he is Gods Å¿ervant, or that the Hebrew word tranÅ¿lated <hi>fellow,</hi> doth import Å¿o much, or that whole ChriÅ¿t is Gods Å¿ervant, is denyed, and is not proved by him; but is his naked aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ertion.</p>
               <p>He concludes thus:</p>

And if Å¿o, I hope one Lord of HoaÅ¿ts is fellow, equall to an other Lord of HoaÅ¿ts and yet it will not follow that there are two Gods, but onely two perÅ¿ons in the Godhead, which do fellow one another, and are equall.</p>

               <p>The next Scripture in my paper, that I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ented him with for the confirming of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted truth of ChriÅ¿t's Godhead, was <hi>John</hi> 3. 13. <hi>No man hath aÅ¿cended up into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but he that came down from heaven, the Son of man, which is in heaven.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>The words</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>may be thus underÅ¿tood, No man hath aÅ¿cended up into heaven, that is, no man hath known thoÅ¿e divine things, &amp;c. but he that came down from heaven, that is, the Son being excepted, who was in heaven, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cended thence for Å¿ome works that he was to do on earth.

               <p> 
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> This interpretation is neither concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant to it Å¿elfe, nor to the truth. 1. To it Å¿elfe it agrees not, becauÅ¿e <hi>aÅ¿cending,</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cending,</hi> and <hi>exiÅ¿ting</hi> in relating all to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, are all to be taken either literally, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the words Å¿ound, or elÅ¿e they are all to be taken metaphorically, and Å¿piritually; but he expounds Å¿ome of them in a myÅ¿ticall figurative Å¿enÅ¿e, and others in a plain literall Å¿enÅ¿e. To aÅ¿cend up to heaven, is not to be underÅ¿tood (as he gives the expoÅ¿ition) of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿onall aÅ¿cenÅ¿ion, but of a mentall contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And to be in heaven, is only in a Å¿piri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Å¿enÅ¿e, in Å¿peculation, in beholding with the eyes of the Å¿oul, divine things, and the Fathers Å¿ecrets. But to deÅ¿cend from heaven, that muÅ¿t have no metaphoricall Å¿enÅ¿e, as the reÅ¿t had, but a literall Å¿enÅ¿e put upon it, and the deÅ¿cenÅ¿ion muÅ¿t be perÅ¿onall. Now here is a diÅ¿cordancie in theÅ¿e things, and he gives no reaÅ¿on of this varying, in his interpreting. AÅ¿cending and deÅ¿cending are alÅ¿o oppoÅ¿ites, and if Å¿o, then they muÅ¿t be taken in an oppoÅ¿ite Å¿enÅ¿e; if <hi>aÅ¿cending</hi> then be taken for deep knowledge, and Å¿cience of divine things; then <hi>deÅ¿cending</hi> is departing from deep knowledge, and Å¿cience of divine things; which will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry abÅ¿urd in his own conceptions. 2. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ition agrees not with the truth; for <hi>aÅ¿cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> in Scripture, is taken when it refers to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48559:52"/> ChriÅ¿t, as well as when it refers to others. In another Å¿enÅ¿e, <hi>viz.</hi> in the plain literall externall Å¿enÅ¿e, <hi>John</hi> 6. 62. <hi>What if you Å¿hall Å¿ee the Son of man aÅ¿cend up where he was before.</hi> And <hi>chap.</hi> 20. 17. <hi>I aÅ¿cend unto my Father and unto your Father, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>touch me not, I am not yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cended.</hi> And <hi>EpheÅ¿.</hi> 4. 8, 9, 10. And I do not remember any one place, where aÅ¿cending into heaven, is taken in his Å¿enÅ¿e, but in the literall Å¿enÅ¿e. And it Å¿eems to be diÅ¿crepant and diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing to the phraÅ¿e and manner of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture expreÅ¿Å¿ion. For when divine knowledge and wiÅ¿dome is Å¿poken of, or other Å¿uch gifts, they are Å¿aid to come down from heaven, from above unto men; and men are not Å¿aid to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cend up to heaven, though there may be a truth in it, that a man aÅ¿cends up to heaven, not in his knowing Å¿o much, as in the uÅ¿e of his knowledge, in his beholding and viewing of Å¿pirituall things.</p>
               <p>And if a Å¿pirituall Å¿enÅ¿e is not proper unto aÅ¿cending into heaven, then is not ChriÅ¿t's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in heaven to be interpreted in a Å¿pirituall or myÅ¿ticall Å¿enÅ¿e; but look in what Å¿enÅ¿e he aÅ¿cended and deÅ¿cended, in that Å¿enÅ¿e it may be Å¿aid he is in heaven, that is, in a literall Å¿enÅ¿e; nor is this Å¿piritual Å¿enÅ¿e of theÅ¿e words <hi>(is in heaven)</hi> agreeable to the acception of the like words, and phraÅ¿e of Å¿peaking uÅ¿ed elÅ¿e-where in <hi>John</hi> 17. 24. <hi>Father, I will that</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:48559:53"/> 
                  <hi>thoÅ¿e whom thou haÅ¿t given me, be where I am, that they may behold my glory.</hi> ChriÅ¿t here Å¿peaks of heaven, and of his glory in heaven, and of the diÅ¿ciples coming thither, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding his glory there; and he Å¿peaks not in a myÅ¿ticall Å¿enÅ¿e, of his own knowledge of divine things, nor of the diÅ¿ciples knowing of Å¿uch things, as he knew; but in a literall Å¿enÅ¿e he Å¿peaks all, and he Å¿aith, <hi>I am there,</hi> and yet he was on earth, according to his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: but he was in heaven alÅ¿o, <hi>Where I am,</hi> Å¿aith he, that was heaven, ChriÅ¿t was there. How was that poÅ¿Å¿ible, if ChriÅ¿t was not God? &amp; if the words be taken literally there, in <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 24 then they are literally to be taken here, in <hi>John</hi> 3. 13. The place diÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿ed betwixt us, the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of theÅ¿e two places together, clears the Å¿enÅ¿e of both, and is repugnant to his interpretation.</p>
               <p>And though he gives a literall Å¿enÅ¿e to theÅ¿e words, <hi>(But he that came down from heaven) viz.</hi> the Son being excepted, who was in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and deÅ¿cended thence; yet it is a corrupt, and falÅ¿e, and very dangerous Å¿enÅ¿e that he gives, which I met with in my former Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿e. For he repreÅ¿ents ChriÅ¿t in his deÅ¿cenÅ¿ion as leaving heaven, departing from thence, and coming upon earth; but this is contrary to the next expreÅ¿Å¿ions, the Å¿enÅ¿e of which I have cleared up, where it is Å¿aid, that ChriÅ¿t was in heaven Å¿till, notwithÅ¿tanding that he
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48559:53"/> deÅ¿cended, Å¿o that it is a reall true deÅ¿cention, or a true coming and appearing upon earth, but not locall, Å¿uch as is appliable to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for that is not proper to ChriÅ¿t. The creature in deÅ¿cending moves from the place it was in, and leaves it: but 'tis not Å¿o to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of ChriÅ¿t. But thus, ChriÅ¿t is Å¿aid to deÅ¿cend in reference to his incarnation, he being the Son of God aÅ¿Å¿umed fleÅ¿h of the Virgine, by the divine inÅ¿piration of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, and Å¿o was made the Son of man, and Å¿o the Son of God, appeared in the Son of man, and this is called deÅ¿cending. This is made manifeÅ¿t to us from <hi>John</hi> 1. 14. <hi>The word was made fleÅ¿h, and dwelt among us,</hi> even the word dwelt among us in fleÅ¿h, and we beheld his glory in fleÅ¿h, the glory as of the begotten Son of God. This glory was in heaven, now in the Sons aÅ¿Å¿uming fleÅ¿h, it is Å¿een on earth, in the Å¿eed of the woman: this is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cending of ChriÅ¿t, and after this manner the moÅ¿t high God is Å¿aid to deÅ¿cend in Scripture, God came into the temple after this manner, not by moving from place to place, which is not congruous to God, but by a work, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring God to be there, where he was not Å¿een before; And Å¿o God deÅ¿cended to Å¿ee the tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that was built in a work, and no other way, and it is called deÅ¿cending after the manner of men, and it is Gods deÅ¿cending, all that
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:48559:54"/> is competent to God. And this kind of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cending of ChriÅ¿t, muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿Å¿ity be yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto, becauÅ¿e the locall is excluded by ChriÅ¿t in the very place, where his deÅ¿cending is mentioned.</p>
               <p>Having Å¿hewed the inconÅ¿iÅ¿tency of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ition which he framed, and gave of this Text of <hi>John,</hi> and having fortified the Å¿enÅ¿e in which I made uÅ¿e of it, and for which I produced it, I Å¿hall now anÅ¿wer unto that which by way of objection may be urged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t the Å¿enÅ¿e that I have put upon it.</p>
               <p>Object.</p>
               <p>It may be thus argued; A locall corporeall aÅ¿cenÅ¿ion cannot be underÅ¿tood in reference to ChriÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e it is expreÅ¿Å¿ed in the preterperfect-TenÅ¿e, as a thing done; but that was (in a literall locall acception taken) inconÅ¿iÅ¿tent to ChriÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e he was then upon earth, and as he Å¿aith afterward, was not aÅ¿cended to the Father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> The preterperfect-tenÅ¿e <hi>(hath aÅ¿cended)</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to <hi>no man,</hi> &amp; not to <hi>ChriÅ¿t;</hi> and there is an <hi>ElipÅ¿is</hi> in the words, or a defectiveneÅ¿s in the expreÅ¿Å¿ions in reference to ChriÅ¿t, &amp; therein of neceÅ¿Å¿ity that the words Å¿upplied Å¿hould run in the preterperfect-tenÅ¿e: but they may run in the future tenÅ¿e, thus, But <hi>he that deÅ¿cended, Å¿hall aÅ¿cend. viz.</hi> the Son of man which is in heaven.</p>
               <p>Or if the words Å¿hould be Å¿upplied in the preterperfect-tenÅ¿e, yet a change of tenÅ¿e
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48559:54"/> (which notes out the aÅ¿Å¿urance of the thing: it is Å¿poken of as done, becauÅ¿e aÅ¿Å¿uredly it is to be done) cannot overturn the genuine Å¿enÅ¿e of the place.</p>
               <p>Obj.</p>
               <p>2. It may be farther objected, that the Å¿on of man is the Å¿ubject who is Å¿aid to be in heaven, but the Å¿on of man is ChriÅ¿t under the conÅ¿ideration of his manhood, and under that conÅ¿ideration it was impoÅ¿Å¿ible for him to be at that time in heaven, for it is contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory to the truth of his humanity to be at two places Å¿o greatly diÅ¿tant at the Å¿ame time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Here is in theÅ¿e expreÅ¿Å¿ions, viz. <hi>the Å¿on of man which is in heaven,</hi> that which they call <hi>Idiomatum communicationem:</hi> that which is Å¿poken in the concrete of ChriÅ¿t, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to one nature, transferred to another nature, is as he himÅ¿elf muÅ¿t confeÅ¿s in other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es, according to his Tenent, to be often found in the Sripture; in theÅ¿e words, <hi>they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have crucified the Lord of glory,</hi> it is to be obÅ¿erved, ChriÅ¿t was crucified according to the fleÅ¿h, but he was not the Lord of glory accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fleÅ¿h, but Å¿pirit of holineÅ¿s, yet it is Å¿aid, the Lord of glory was crucified: Å¿o it is Å¿aid, the Å¿on of man was in heaven, but it is meant of the Å¿on of God; and the meaning is, the perÅ¿on that is called the Å¿on of man, was in heaven, though not as the Å¿on of man, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48559:55"/> to the other nature <hi>as the Son of God.</hi>

And that ChriÅ¿ts being in heaven in the Å¿enÅ¿e that he clothes it with, is repugnant to a paralell place in <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 24. Å¿o that he makes Scripture quarrell with it Å¿elfe, and Å¿uch an expoÅ¿ition which he hath given of ChriÅ¿ts deÅ¿cending, Å¿tands at defiance againÅ¿t all thoÅ¿e pregnant places which do proclaim ChriÅ¿t to be coeÅ¿Å¿ential with the Father: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both Old TeÅ¿tament and New will riÅ¿e up againÅ¿t it, and condemn it.</p>

As for <hi>PiÅ¿cator,</hi> I have never Å¿een him upon the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> and can Å¿ay nothing to it.</p>
               <p>He mentions <hi>Pauls</hi> rapture into the third heaven to be only a diÅ¿covery of the things of God. It's Å¿omewhat preÅ¿umptuous for him to determine, when the ApoÅ¿tle himÅ¿elf durÅ¿t not: for, <hi>whether he was in the body, or out of the body, he could not tell.</hi> But if his rapture

               <p>But he quotes <hi>Grotius,</hi> and <hi>MuÅ¿culus,</hi> and <hi>Bucer,</hi> as Writers who underÅ¿tand <hi>aÅ¿cend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in a Å¿pirituall Å¿enÅ¿e for penetrating the Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of heaven.</p>

               <p n="1">1. He inÅ¿erts theÅ¿e words into the preface of ChriÅ¿ts prayer, <hi>Thou, O Father, who art the fountain of goodneÅ¿s.</hi> And this he doth unneÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿arily, for in this prayer-of ChriÅ¿t there is no preface at all, and why Å¿hould be frame one? this is not to interpret Scripture, but it is plainly to add to it, and it is done with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿igne, which makes it the worÅ¿e; for he would bring ChriÅ¿t in, acknowledging the Father the Å¿ole fountain of goodneÅ¿Å¿e, excluding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe, as Son of the Father, and excluding the Holy GhoÅ¿t, which is a falÅ¿e thing, and full of injury to ChriÅ¿t; who was Å¿o far from making Å¿uch an acknowledgment, that he thought it not robbery to be equall with God, his aÅ¿Å¿uming of equality with the Father, was not counted robbery by himÅ¿elfe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He inÅ¿erts theÅ¿e words in the cloÅ¿e of ChriÅ¿ts prayer, Å¿peaking of the glory ChriÅ¿t had with God, he addes theÅ¿e words, <hi>anÅ¿werable to that high Å¿tate wherein thy pleaÅ¿ure was to Å¿et me, and to that great dominion wherewithall thou wast pleaÅ¿ed to invest me.</hi> TheÅ¿e words, <hi>wherein thy good pleaÅ¿ure was to Å¿et me, and wherewithall thou wast pleaÅ¿ed to invest me,</hi> are
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48559:58"/> not in the text, nor is there any thing that lookes that way, that might give him occaÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to extract them, and preÅ¿ent them, as if there they might be found, or Å¿omething like them, which will bear them; nor doth he bring any other text to make it appear, that Å¿uch words are agreeable to the Analogie of faith. But by this addition he makes ChriÅ¿t a meere creature, a creature before he tooke fleÅ¿h, before the World was, while he was with God. And he makes the glory which he had to be a derived glory, and given to ChriÅ¿t of meere grace, and good pleaÅ¿ure. Now this is moÅ¿t notoriouÅ¿ly falÅ¿e, as I have largely and amply proved in my former TreatiÅ¿e. But this is the doctrine that fils his head, and fils his heart, and there is Å¿o much of this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, that he thinks every Scripture that he lookes upon contains it, and therefore it is that he brings this Scripture, Å¿peaking that which it Å¿peakes not.</p>
               <p>But Å¿etting aÅ¿ide theÅ¿e additions, for which he muÅ¿t give an account. Be it that ChriÅ¿ts prayer had this meaning, I Å¿hall Å¿hew you what an inconÅ¿iÅ¿tency there is in theÅ¿e words to his opinion, in two or three parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. SuppoÅ¿ing ChriÅ¿t (before he tooke the Seed of <hi>Ahraham</hi> upon him) to be a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Å¿oul, made by and abiding with God, be
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:48559:58"/> fore the reÅ¿t of the creatures were made (for this is his opinion) how can ChriÅ¿t Å¿peake to God theÅ¿e words? <hi>Who have emptied my Å¿elfe, taking to me a naturall, and mortall body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If ChriÅ¿t were but a created Å¿oul, could it be an act of his will, and of his power, to take to him a body? did ever God leave any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at liberty to do what he will? to chuÅ¿e or refuÅ¿e at his pleaÅ¿ure? that he Å¿hould leave ChriÅ¿t (this created Å¿oul as he makes him) at liberty, to take a body, or not to take it? and if not, but that God commanded him to take it, why doth he plead it with God for reward, as if it had been done of courteÅ¿ie? Have any of the Angels, when they have waited upon men (a worke below them) had liberty to plead with God after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? And how could it be an act of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to take to him a body, he being but a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Å¿oul? can a created Å¿oul build a body of nothing (if by creation it be?) or build it out of a woman without the help of man (if by generation it be (as indeed it was?) and if not, how comes ChriÅ¿t to plead it as Å¿ome meritorious act, I have emptied my Å¿elfe in taking to me a naturall mortall body? If God prepared him a body, why doth he Å¿ay, I emptied my Å¿elfe and tooke it? So that here is abÅ¿urdity enough in this, if there were no
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:48559:59"/> more in reference to his opinion, in theÅ¿e ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry words.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If ChriÅ¿t were a created Å¿oul, where was the Emptying to take a naturall and mortall body? is there not an habitude and naturall propenÅ¿eneÅ¿Å¿e in the Å¿oul to be in the body? is it not the Å¿oules perfection? is not the Å¿oul imperfect without it? is it any more then a part of the whole, and with the body makes a perfect man? and is this the condeÅ¿cention (to be preÅ¿ented as an high piece of Å¿elfe deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all) to be in a perfect Å¿tate? And doth the Å¿oul take the body, any more then the body take the Å¿oul? or doth not God take both and unite them? here is neither Divinity nor Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loÅ¿ophy in this.</p>
               <p>But it may be, this emptying was in this, that ChriÅ¿t a glorious Å¿oul, tooke a naturall mortall body, not a body glorified, but vile by reaÅ¿on of a naturall corruptibility; But 1. God prepared this body for him; where was then this excellent piece of Å¿elfe denyall, to take and accept of what God prepares, though it were an abaÅ¿ing to him? Saints tread in Å¿uch Å¿teps of Å¿elfe denyall every day, and it is but their duty. 2. Men are and ought to be thankful to God for Å¿uch naturall and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall bodies, and for every member thereof, and ChriÅ¿t, if but a created Å¿oul, might well Å¿ubmit, yea be thankfull that his Å¿oul was not
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48559:59"/> as his body; for it was of free-grace (as he Å¿aith, and I joyn with him in it, if he were a created Å¿oul) that he was Å¿o glorious a Å¿oul. 3. <hi>Lazarus</hi> was called (Å¿o far as concerned a naturall mortall body, and further alÅ¿o) to the like piece of Å¿elf-denyall: for his Å¿oul was in heaven, and with God, and made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect with God, and glorified with him; and it muÅ¿t leave God, and leave heaven, and leave glory, and come into a naturall mortall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy again, that muÅ¿t dye a Å¿econd time; yea, into a Å¿infull tabernacle again; and this muÅ¿t be done at the Command of ChriÅ¿t, according to the will of God. What Å¿elf-denyall was this then, if ChriÅ¿t's was Å¿o great, when yet ChriÅ¿t was but only a glorified Å¿oul; And <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> which was Å¿uch, yet might not <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> plead it? This is another abÅ¿urdity which follows from his own words, upon his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: ChriÅ¿t being but a created Å¿oul at the firÅ¿t with God.</p>
               <p>2. He makes ChriÅ¿t to ask of God the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry only which he had in heaven before the world was; and indeed ChriÅ¿t asked no other but it. Now this is not conÅ¿iÅ¿tent with ChriÅ¿ts being a created Å¿oul, and a creature; for it is manifeÅ¿t from the Scripture, yea, it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿t by himÅ¿elfe in many places of his printed paper, That ChriÅ¿t as a creature had greater glory by donation, after his Å¿ufferings, after
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48559:60"/> his deep humiliation, then ever he had as a creature before; for that HeirÅ¿hip of all things, and dominion, and principality, and height above all principality, and that name above every name, was the reward which God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿towed upon him in reference to the croÅ¿Å¿e which he bore; and it was his higheÅ¿t glory as a creature; therefore it is expreÅ¿Å¿ed in theÅ¿e words, <hi>is made both Lord and ChriÅ¿t;</hi> not reÅ¿tored to what he had, but made: and what a rewarding is that, only to reÅ¿tore him to what he had at firÅ¿t? Therefore Å¿eeing that ChriÅ¿t prayes here in <hi>John</hi> for the glory that he had with God before the world was, and asked no more; and Å¿eeing it is as evident, that as a creature his greateÅ¿t glory was not before his Å¿ufferings, but after, and was the reward of his Å¿ufferings; it will neceÅ¿Å¿arily follow, that he prayes for divine glory to be reÅ¿tored, and that as a creature he was not with God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world was, nor had glory as a creature.</p>
               <p>3. He Å¿aith, and the Text Å¿aith, that the glory that ChriÅ¿t asked of his Father, was the glory before the world was, but the glory which ChriÅ¿t had as a creature, could not be the glory before the world was; for he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe confeÅ¿Å¿eth, that that glory which he had as a creature, conÅ¿iÅ¿ted in heirÅ¿hip and dominion over the world; but this heirÅ¿hip and dominion over the world, was not, nor could
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48559:60"/> be before the world was: it will therefore follow, that either ChriÅ¿t was created with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out glory, and had no glory till the world was created, which is directly contradictory to the Text; or if he had a glory, it was not any created glory, for that conÅ¿iÅ¿ted in domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which was not til the world was; and then what glory could it be, but that which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for, divine uncreated glory, which holds forth him to be an uncreated and eternal being; and by conÅ¿equence to be the moÅ¿t high God?</p>
               <p>But he brings reaÅ¿ons for his own tenent, that whole ChriÅ¿t is a creature, from this Text of <hi>John,</hi> and attempts the overthrow of my aÅ¿Å¿ertion of ChriÅ¿ts Deity, which I contend for from this Text.</p>
               <p>1. Saith he, <hi>If ChriÅ¿t were equall with the Father, why doth ChriÅ¿t direct his prayer to his Father? There had been no need, nor can cauÅ¿e be Å¿hewed, why he Å¿hould Å¿upplicate to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and not act relyance on the Godhead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> I have rendred reaÅ¿ons for it in my former TreatiÅ¿e, in my reply to his fift argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was this, <hi>He that acteth with dependance on another, is a creature, but whole ChriÅ¿t acteth with dependance.</hi> To which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the reader, becauÅ¿e it is largely diÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿ed there; and it is a tedious unpleaÅ¿ing thing to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48559:61"/> multiply repetitions, though he delights him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe too much therein: yet leÅ¿t that TreatiÅ¿e Å¿hould not be at hand, I Å¿hall Å¿atisfie the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thus far. It behooved the Godhead in the perÅ¿on of the Son to be veyled, for this was the Sons emptying of himÅ¿elfe; but not Å¿o the Godhead in the perÅ¿on of the Father; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Son acts not dependance upon the Godhead that dwelt in himÅ¿elf in the perÅ¿on of the Son; or as it was in himÅ¿elf, but as it was in the Father.</p>
               <p>2. He Å¿aith, <hi>We do not uÅ¿e to pray, but praiÅ¿e for things we have, if we know that we have them. Now ChriÅ¿t could not want the higheÅ¿t glory in any Å¿enÅ¿e, if he were a perÅ¿on in the Trinity, coequall with the Father, eÅ¿pecially not be without it, with the Father, nor in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in any Å¿enÅ¿e whatÅ¿oever, as by the clouding, darkning, or obÅ¿curing of it; therefore the glory which he had with the Father, was not the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eÅ¿t glory, but a glory proceeding from the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eÅ¿t; and by conÅ¿equence, ChriÅ¿t was but a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> It is true, that the higheÅ¿t glory (he being a perÅ¿on in the Trinity coequall with the Father) could not be Å¿eparated from him, for it follows the divine eÅ¿Å¿ence, and cannot be divided from it; but it might be, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deedwas obÅ¿cured, and clouded, not to the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48559:61"/> Father, nor to the Son himÅ¿elfe; for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Å¿aw it, and gave witneÅ¿Å¿e to it, and Å¿o did the Son, and comprehended it fully: but to the creature it was darkned and obÅ¿cured, and but Å¿ome Å¿mall beams and rayes of it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared; the Son was incarnate, or in fleÅ¿h, but the glory of the Son appeared not in fleÅ¿h in fulneÅ¿Å¿e of luÅ¿tre, like the glory of the Son; but the form of God in the Son was veyled and hidden in the form of a Å¿ervant; Now ChriÅ¿t prayes that that eÅ¿Å¿entiall divine glory might be manifeÅ¿ted in fleÅ¿h, that he the Son in fleÅ¿h might appear in glory, when he Å¿hould come to heaven, as he did before he took fleÅ¿h; that as the Godhead was hidden in the manhood, Å¿o the manhood might be glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Godhead, that the fleÅ¿h might be taken up into the fellowÅ¿hip of the glory of the Divinity, by the Å¿hining forth and breaking out of the glory of the Divinity in the fleÅ¿h.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>It appears</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>that the glory which he had with the Father was not divine, or the higheÅ¿t glory, becauÅ¿e it was to be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Glorifie me, O Father, with that glory, &amp;c. Now the higheÅ¿t glory being infinite, could not be given or communicated to the humane nature, which was finite, and Å¿o uncapable of it, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> Though the divine glory cannot be
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48559:62"/> communicated to humane nature, Å¿o as that it Å¿hould be inherent in the humane nature; yet it may gloriouÅ¿ly Å¿hine forth upon it, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in it, which it did not before: yea by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on of the hypoÅ¿taticall union betwixt the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature and the humane nature, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the divine nature becomes the glory of the whole perÅ¿on, Å¿o as that when the glory of the Son Å¿hines forth in its greateÅ¿t Å¿trength in the fleÅ¿h, it may be predicated and aÅ¿Å¿erted of the man ChriÅ¿t, that he is glorified with the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which the Son had with the Father before the world was; BecauÅ¿e the man ChriÅ¿t is the Å¿ame perÅ¿on with the eternall Son of God.</p>
               <p>Thus all the Scriptures which I drew wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s to, that JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t is the true God, and the moÅ¿t high God, notwithÅ¿tanding all his endeavours to Å¿uffocate their teÅ¿timony, and his attempts by violence to Å¿ilence them, that they Å¿hould not Å¿peak what they would Å¿peak, yet they have with open mouth, with one conÅ¿ent, given glory unto ChriÅ¿t, by witneÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing to his Godhead, and to his coeÅ¿Å¿enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alneÅ¿s, and to his coequality with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>I Å¿hall conclude my Vindication of them with theÅ¿e words, <hi>Let God be true</hi> in what he hath teÅ¿tifyed of his Son in Scripture,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:48559:62"/> 
                  <hi>and every man</hi> that oppoÅ¿eth let him be <hi>a lyer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My next undertaking muÅ¿t be the defence of the Arguments which I produced, and drew up from Scripture, by which I attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to prove the deÅ¿tructiveneÅ¿Å¿e of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which he holds (making whole ChriÅ¿t a creature) to the true GoÅ¿pel, and oppoÅ¿ite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s of it to the Scripture in many main points and truths of it.</p>
               <p>My AÅ¿Å¿ertion was, That the doctrine which makes ChriÅ¿t a meer creature, brings in (as it were) another GoÅ¿pel, and deÅ¿troyes the true GoÅ¿pel in many parts thereof; and brings in another Scripture in many main points.</p>
               <p>He cals this a reaÅ¿on againÅ¿t his doctrine of ChriÅ¿t a meere creature; and Å¿o it is, not onely to Å¿hew the falÅ¿eneÅ¿Å¿e of Å¿uch doctrine, but alÅ¿o to diÅ¿cover the horridneÅ¿Å¿e and hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouÅ¿neÅ¿s of the doctrine, that all might be warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of it, and with fear and trembling may decline it.</p>
               <p>But he wiÅ¿heth him to be <hi>Anathema</hi> that holds any Å¿uch doctrine, that deÅ¿troyes the GoÅ¿pel or the Scripture, and falls upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of the inÅ¿tances or Arguments which I produced to confirme that generall reaÅ¿on.</p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:48559:63"/>
               <p> Therefore becauÅ¿e he is Å¿o confident, that his doctrine will not prove Å¿uch; and becauÅ¿e he hath poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed the people, that though there Å¿hould be a miÅ¿take in it on his part, yet it is not Å¿o dangerous as I would make it; and that the Å¿alvation of mens Å¿oules is not Å¿o nearly concerned in it, as I would have men to conceive; and that ChriÅ¿t is never a whit leÅ¿s a Å¿ufficient Saviour, though but a creature; and that it is enough to beleeve unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that ChriÅ¿t is Lord, <hi>viz. made Lord;</hi> and that God raiÅ¿ed him from the dead; by which means perÅ¿ons have become leÅ¿Å¿e Å¿olicitous what doctrine they entertain, they Å¿ee it hath a Å¿pecious Å¿hew, and conceive it will not prove deÅ¿tructive, though it Å¿hould prove falÅ¿e; therefore I think it expedient to fortifie my poÅ¿ition, which reÅ¿pects the oppoÅ¿iteneÅ¿Å¿e of this doctrine of his, both to the GoÅ¿pel, and the teÅ¿timony of other Scriptures, with Å¿ome further proofes, not purpoÅ¿ing at all to deÅ¿ert my former grounds, (which I confide in as much as ever) but intending in my following diÅ¿courÅ¿e to free them from his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaÅ¿ions, by which he would elude the Å¿trength of them.</p>
               <p>And thus I argue:</p>
            </div>
            <div n="1" type="argument">
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. That doctrine that denyes and deÅ¿troyes that one onely true God, and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48559:63"/> brings in a Å¿trange and a falÅ¿e God, that Doctrine deÅ¿troyes the true GoÅ¿pel and Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and brings in another GoÅ¿pel and Scriptures: But this Doctrine of his, that makes whole ChriÅ¿t a creature, doth Å¿o: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Major admits of no doubt, becauÅ¿e the Scripture is cleer, that there is <hi>but one onely true God,</hi> Deut. 6. 4. 1 Cor. 8. 6.</p>
               <p>The Minor muÅ¿t have proof, and thus I confirm it: If the one onely true God be both three and one, three in PerÅ¿ons, and one in EÅ¿Å¿ence; be Father, Son, and Spirit, which are called three, and yet are but one; then that Doctrine which makes God to be but one and one, <hi>viz.</hi> one in perÅ¿on, and one in eÅ¿Å¿ence, and makes the Father onely to be God, excluding the Son and Spirit, denyes and deÅ¿troyes the true God, and Å¿ets up a falÅ¿e God.</p>
               <p>My proof for the Minor again (for the Major is unqueÅ¿tionable) is 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 7, 9. <hi>There are three that bear witneÅ¿s in heaven, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Word, and the Spirit, and theÅ¿e three are one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What will he anÅ¿wer to this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</p>
               <p>He will not deny, but that the three that are here Å¿poken of, <hi>the Father, the Word, and the</hi>

                  <hi>Spirit</hi> are three perÅ¿ons, (for he hath gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it all along in his diÅ¿courÅ¿e, that they are three diÅ¿tinct perÅ¿ons) but the oneneÅ¿s of theÅ¿e three in eÅ¿Å¿ence, is that which he denyes; that they are one God, is not yeilded by him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e the words <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>However it be, there is Å¿trength enough in this argument to them that grant the God-head of ChriÅ¿t; they muÅ¿t confeÅ¿s whether they will or no, that the true God is denyed, and a falÅ¿e God brought in: for if the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:48559:64"/> be God, and the Son be God, and the Son be not the Father, nor the Father the Son: and yet there be not two Gods, but one God; then this one God is the Father and Son, (I do not exclude the Spirit, but I Å¿peak to thoÅ¿e who acknowledge Father and Son both of them to be God) they muÅ¿t confeÅ¿s that they are both of them but one and the Å¿ame God; and then it comes to this, that the true God is one in two, and it is two in one, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their tenent, that is, one God in eÅ¿Å¿ence, and two in perÅ¿ons, or two perÅ¿ons in one eÅ¿Å¿ence: the conÅ¿equence of which is this, they muÅ¿t conclude, that whoever makes the eÅ¿Å¿ence to be one, and the perÅ¿on to be but one, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be God, and he alone to be God, and the Son not to be God, much leÅ¿s the holy GhoÅ¿t, Å¿uch an one brings in a Å¿trange God, and unÅ¿cripturall God, deÅ¿troyes the true God which is Father and Son, as themÅ¿elves acknowledg, yea and Spirit alÅ¿o, as they will not deny. And how then can any Å¿uch perÅ¿on make the denying of ChriÅ¿t to be God a triviall errour, not greatly conÅ¿equential, nor of Å¿uch moment, as to be Å¿o greatly contended for? not fundamentall nor damnable, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iÅ¿ted
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:48559:65"/> in? when as yet it is the denying of the onely God, which is not Father alone, but Father, Son and Spirit.</p>
               <p>But why Å¿hould I conteÅ¿t with friends, which confeÅ¿Å¿e the Diety of ChriÅ¿t? I am Å¿orry there Å¿hould be any occaÅ¿ion, I will turn again upon the adverÅ¿ary.</p>
               <p>Either Father and Son (I exclude not the Spirit, but I am pleading the Sons God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and not the Spirits, and Å¿hewing the heinouÅ¿neÅ¿s of the errour of denying it) I Å¿ay either the Father and the Son are the onely God, or elÅ¿e there is no God at all, for the Scripture Å¿aith <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 30 <hi>that the Father and ChriÅ¿t are one in power,</hi> which is an eÅ¿Å¿entiall attribute, and then they are one in eÅ¿Å¿ence, and Å¿o one God; and yet they are two diÅ¿tinct perÅ¿ons. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 17. 18. <hi>It is written in your law, that the teÅ¿timony of two men is true, I am one that bear witneÅ¿s of my Å¿elf, and my Father heareth witneÅ¿s of me.</hi> If the Father and the Son be two diÅ¿tinct witneÅ¿Å¿es, then they two are diÅ¿tinct perÅ¿ons; for none can be witneÅ¿Å¿es but perÅ¿ons; and two manifeÅ¿tati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Å¿ame perÅ¿on cannot be Å¿aid to be two diÅ¿tinct witneÅ¿Å¿es; nor would the proof which is fetcht from the law (where the witneÅ¿Å¿es were diÅ¿tinct perÅ¿ons) be Å¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:48559:65"/> But he will confeÅ¿s this, that the Father and Son are diÅ¿tinct perÅ¿ons, and diÅ¿tinct witneÅ¿Å¿es alÅ¿o: and if Å¿o, he cannot with any face deny the other, that they are one, as well as two, becauÅ¿e ChriÅ¿t Å¿aith Å¿o in the above named place; one, <hi>viz.</hi> in power, in eÅ¿Å¿ence, in Godhead. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the very context (where they are called two witneÅ¿Å¿es) will witneÅ¿s that they are but one God. the Jews reject his witneÅ¿s of himÅ¿elf, Å¿uch as they took him to be, which was a meer man (for the law alowed it not that any man Å¿hould be admitted to bear witneÅ¿s of himÅ¿elf;) but he notwithÅ¿tanding bears himÅ¿elf out by the law, to be an adequate witneÅ¿Å¿e of himÅ¿elf; but herein he hath recourÅ¿e to that of himÅ¿elf, which they Å¿aw not, which they knew not, as <hi>ver.</hi> 14. Å¿hewes, <hi>I know whence I came, ye cannot tell whence I came.</hi> He could not mean it of his Å¿oul, for they could not look upon him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Å¿oul, and Å¿oul and body made but one man; and notwithÅ¿tanding both, he would be an unadequate witneÅ¿s of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf: But he means another thing, diÅ¿tinct both from Å¿oul and body, and from his manhood; which might be a witneÅ¿s of him as man, and this could be nothing
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:48559:66"/> but his Godhead and he joynes himÅ¿elf (according to this) with the Father, as a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tinct witneÅ¿s, but the Å¿ame God. The reÅ¿ult is then, that the one true <hi>God,</hi> though but one in eÅ¿Å¿ence, yet is not one Å¿ingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on, but Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿ts in a plurality of perÅ¿ons. Therefore he that makes his Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿tence to be Å¿ingle, and Å¿uch as his eÅ¿Å¿ence is, denyes and deÅ¿troyes this one onely God. Which I prove further.</p>
               <p>The Father is Å¿aid to be <hi>the onely true God, John</hi> 17. 3. and the Son is called the <hi>true God,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 20. This Adjective <hi>[onely]</hi> refers not to the Å¿ubject perÅ¿on <hi>Father,</hi> but refers to the predicate or thing that the Father is Å¿aid to be, <hi>viz. the true God,</hi> which is but <hi>onely</hi> one, which is clear from a paralell place in <hi>Jer.</hi> 22. 30. where the word <hi>onely</hi> is uÅ¿ed in like manner, the children of IÅ¿rael and <hi>Judah</hi> have <hi>onely done evill, have onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked me,</hi> The word <hi>onely</hi> is not to be applyed to the Å¿ubject perÅ¿ons Å¿poken of, as if they onely, and no other people had done evill, and provoked God; but it is to be applyed to the thing that is Å¿poken of them, <hi>they have only done evill, and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provoked;</hi> that is, they have done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elÅ¿e but evill, nothing elÅ¿e but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke;
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:48559:66"/> Å¿o in <hi>John,</hi> the Father is Å¿aid to be the one only true God, but not he only to be the true God; for the Son is called the true <hi>God</hi> as wel as he, in the place before named in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 20. Whence I argue, that the one only true God is Father and Son, (as for the holy GhoÅ¿t, I always include him though I have not occaÅ¿ion to Å¿peak of him here:) &amp; there is no God, no true God, but that God that is Father and Son; and he that denys either of theÅ¿e, denyes this one onely true <hi>God.</hi> He then that acknowlegeth the perÅ¿on of the Father to be <hi>God,</hi> but acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the perÅ¿on of the Son to be God, brings in a Å¿trange God, an unÅ¿criptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall God, and a falÅ¿e God. For there is no Å¿uch God as Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿ts in the perÅ¿on of the Father onely; and hence it is that the ApoÅ¿tle <hi>John</hi> Å¿aith, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 22, 23. he is an AntichriÅ¿t that denyeth the Father and the Son: And he that denyeth the Son, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Father alÅ¿o; that is, Å¿uch an one acknowledgeth not the true God at all, what-ever men may think of him.</p>
               <p>Yet further, the Father is called the <hi>only God, Joh.</hi> 17. 3. &amp; <hi>ChriÅ¿t</hi> is cald the <hi>only God, Jud.</hi> 4, 24, 25.

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48559:67"/> the one place, <hi>they creep in at unawares</hi> in the other place. <hi>They walke after the fleÅ¿h, and deÅ¿piÅ¿e government</hi> in one place, <hi>They defile the fleÅ¿h, deÅ¿piÅ¿e dominion</hi> in the other place. <hi>Their judgement of long time lingreth not, and their damnation Å¿lumbreth not,</hi> in one place; <hi>and they were before of old ordained to condemnation</hi> in the other place. Their ruine is Å¿et forth by <hi>the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿hment which God inflicted upon the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells that fell, and upon the old world, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah in one place; and in the other place <hi>by the Children of</hi> IÅ¿rael <hi>that fell in the WilderneÅ¿Å¿e by unbeliefe, and by the ApoÅ¿tate Angells, and by</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah <hi>and the Cities about them.</hi> So that it Å¿eems to be one and the Å¿ame Prophecie wherewith both <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Jude</hi> were inÅ¿pired, and which they have left upon record for the benefit of the Church: Therefore the one muÅ¿t help to expound the other: the crime then of <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying</hi> (which both the ApoÅ¿tles Å¿peake of) hath the Å¿ame object, <hi>viz.</hi> JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, and not the Father: it is clear that ChriÅ¿t alone is the object of that wicked act of thoÅ¿e Å¿poken of in <hi>Peter;</hi> therefore ChriÅ¿t alone and not the Father, is the object of the Å¿ame wicked act Å¿poken of in <hi>Jude.</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:48559:68"/> And indeed there were never any ChriÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Teachers, (and of Å¿uch both the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tles Å¿peake) that did deny the Father to be God, but the Son JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t was denyed by many. And if we make a Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious inÅ¿pection into <hi>verÅ¿e</hi> 25. of <hi>Jude,</hi> and compare it with the precedent <hi>verÅ¿e,</hi> we Å¿hall find that ChriÅ¿t is Å¿poken of, and not the Father; and if Å¿o, then ChriÅ¿t is called the <hi>onely wiÅ¿e God;</hi> for it is the Å¿ame perÅ¿on that preÅ¿ents Å¿aints faultleÅ¿s before the preÅ¿ence of his glory, who is called the <hi>onely wiÅ¿e God.</hi> But who is that? The ApoÅ¿tle <hi>Paul</hi> declares who he is in <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 27. it is ChriÅ¿t, who is deÅ¿cribed <hi>to give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe for the Chuch, and to have waÅ¿hed it with his owne bloud, that he may preÅ¿ent it a glorious Church to himÅ¿elfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whence I thus Argue, If the Father be the <hi>only God,</hi> and if the Son be alÅ¿o the <hi>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God,</hi> and yet there are not two <hi>only Gods,</hi> but one <hi>onely God,</hi> then this one <hi>onely God</hi> is both Father and Son; that is, this one <hi>onely God,</hi> though but one in eÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ence, yet is two at leaÅ¿t in perÅ¿ons (but indeed is three, but that is Å¿omewhat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ide my undertaking;) and then it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that that God where an unity one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is granted, both in eÅ¿Å¿ence and perÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:48559:68"/> is not the onely God, which the GoÅ¿pel and other Scriptures hold out, and conÅ¿equently is a falÅ¿e God: for I would ask this queÅ¿tion, Å¿uppoÅ¿e a perÅ¿on Å¿hould acknowledge ChriÅ¿t to be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God, and Å¿hould deny the Father to be God, could this man be Å¿aid to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the one onely true God which the Scriptures Å¿peak of? I Å¿uppoÅ¿e none will be Å¿o abÅ¿urd as to aÅ¿Å¿ert it, therefore if ChriÅ¿t be the onely God as the Father is, he that acknowledgeth the Father without him, acknowledgeth not the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true God; and Å¿o is guilty of deÅ¿troy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures, and bringing in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scripture in a maine fundamental point of it.</p>

               <p> The Major is Å¿o void of controverÅ¿ie, that it will not be Å¿tuck at; but the Minor will be denyed, and therefore muÅ¿t be confirmed.</p>
               <p>That doctrine that denyes ChriÅ¿t to be the proper Son of God, and makes ChriÅ¿t to be onely the Son of man, that doctrine denyes and deÅ¿troyes that one only true ChriÅ¿t, and brings in a Å¿trange and a falÅ¿e ChriÅ¿t; but this doctrine of his doth thus; therefore this doctrine of his denyes and deÅ¿troyes that onely true ChriÅ¿t, and brings in a falÅ¿e ChriÅ¿t, and Å¿trange to Scripture.</p>
               <p>The Major will again paÅ¿Å¿e without exception, but proofe will be required for the Minor; And I confirme it thus.</p>
               <p>That doctrine which takes ChriÅ¿ts God-head from him, that doctrine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies ChriÅ¿t to be the proper Son of God, and makes him to be meerly the Å¿on of man: But this doctrine of his which makes ChriÅ¿t to be a meere creature, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, takes ChriÅ¿ts God-head from him. Therefore this doctrine of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes him to be the proper Son of God, and makes him to be meerely and only the Å¿on of man.</p>
               <p>The Major wil now only be in queÅ¿tion;
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:48559:69"/> for the Minor is (without queÅ¿tion) true, if <hi>God-head</hi> be taken in a proper Å¿enÅ¿e, as I have taken it in my arguing with him all along.</p>
               <p>For the proofe then of the Major pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ition, I Å¿hall preÅ¿ent and make out two things, 1. that theÅ¿e two things <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Son of God</hi> are all one in reference to ChriÅ¿t; therefore whoever teacheth any doctrine againÅ¿t the one, <hi>viz.</hi> that ChriÅ¿t is <hi>not God,</hi> teacheth doctrine againÅ¿t the other, <hi>viz.</hi> that ChriÅ¿t is not the <hi>Son of God.</hi> 2. ChriÅ¿t cannot be God any other way; or under any other conÅ¿ideration, but as he is the Son of God.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Son of God</hi> are all one thing in reference to ChriÅ¿t: my meaning is not that the termes are confounded, for the word <hi>(God)</hi> reÅ¿pects the eÅ¿Å¿ence, more properly and Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿ting in a perÅ¿on; and the words <hi>(Son of God)</hi> reÅ¿pect the Å¿econd perÅ¿on in the Trinity, as diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed from the Father, and the holy GhoÅ¿t Å¿ubÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ting in the Godhead. But my meaning is, that where ever the one is expreÅ¿Å¿ed, the other is implyed, and that a divine perÅ¿on Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿ting in the Godhead is meant evermore; and in the order of exiÅ¿ting and working, the Å¿econd perÅ¿on; for proofe
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:48559:70"/> of this, conÅ¿ider theÅ¿e following parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elf confounds theÅ¿e two, <hi>God, and Son of God,</hi> by uÅ¿ing them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿cuouÅ¿ly, <hi>John</hi> 10. 33. 36. In <hi>ver.</hi> 33. the Jewes Å¿aid they Å¿toned him becauÅ¿e <hi>he blaÅ¿phemed, and Å¿aid he was God;</hi> ChriÅ¿t re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats their words, and blames them for charging him with blaÅ¿phemie, <hi>becauÅ¿e he Å¿aid he was the Son of God, ver.</hi> 36. thoÅ¿e were not their expreÅ¿Å¿ions, but ChriÅ¿t makes them their expreÅ¿Å¿ions, therefore in a Å¿enÅ¿e they were one and the Å¿ame thing, and <hi>Son of God,</hi> was as much as <hi>God,</hi> elÅ¿e ChriÅ¿t had both extenuated their fault, &amp; Å¿poken untruly of them. But in truth and deed ChriÅ¿t Å¿aid of himÅ¿elf neither the one nor the other in expreÅ¿s words, but Å¿aid, <hi>he and his Father were one, ver.</hi> 30. and if the <hi>Son of God</hi> did not import as much as God, their collection in their own words that he made himÅ¿elfe God, in making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe one with the Father, was more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall in reference to ChriÅ¿ts words, then as ChriÅ¿t repeated them. For the Father is God, and not the Son of God, and when ChriÅ¿t Å¿aid, he and his Father were one, they might rather conclude that ChriÅ¿t made himÅ¿elfe <hi>God,</hi> then that he
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:48559:70"/> made himÅ¿elf <hi>the Son of God,</hi> unleÅ¿s the Son of God were alÅ¿o <hi>God,</hi> and Å¿o ChriÅ¿t might be the Son of God, and yet one in Godhead with the Father.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ApoÅ¿tle <hi>John,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 20. makes <hi>the Son of God</hi> and <hi>the true God</hi> to be all one in reference to ChriÅ¿t, <hi>You are in him that is true, even in his Son JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t:</hi> and this <hi>true one,</hi> this <hi>Son JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t,</hi> this very perÅ¿on, <hi>is the true God.</hi> As if the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tle Å¿hould have Å¿aid, when I Å¿peak of the Son of God, I would have you to know whom I mean by him, I do not mean a man, a meer creature, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elÅ¿e, but I mean a perÅ¿on that is the true God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ApoÅ¿tles in their profeÅ¿Å¿ions of faith, if they do agree therein, (and I Å¿uppoÅ¿e none will Å¿ay that they do diÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree therein) do make theÅ¿e two to be one and the Å¿ame thing. The ApoÅ¿tle <hi>Peter</hi> profeÅ¿Å¿eth his faith in theÅ¿e words, <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that thou art ChriÅ¿t the Son of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God.</hi> But the ApoÅ¿tle <hi>Thomas</hi> in theÅ¿e words, <hi>My Lord, and my God. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> beleeved him to be <hi>the Son of God, Thomas</hi> beleeved him to be <hi>very God,</hi> and <hi>very Lord,</hi> yea <hi>his God</hi> and <hi>his Lord</hi> in an applicative way; and ChriÅ¿t doth
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:48559:71"/> not look upon one as two low for him, nor upon the other as too high for him; but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both as profeÅ¿Å¿ions of their true faith in him; he tells <hi>Peter,</hi> that upon the rock of Å¿uch a profeÅ¿Å¿ion he would build his Church; and he puts a bleÅ¿Å¿ing upon all thoÅ¿e that Å¿hall beleeve as <hi>Thomas</hi> belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, his Å¿lowneÅ¿s only to beleeve (depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon Å¿ight) excepted.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The grounds whereupon the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of ChriÅ¿t have Å¿ome of them Å¿tiled him <hi>the Son of God,</hi> and others of them have Å¿tiled him <hi>God,</hi> are alike, and high enough (all of them) to cauÅ¿e them to entitle him <hi>God. Nathaneel</hi> Å¿ees his om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipreÅ¿ence and omniÅ¿cience, when ChriÅ¿t told him, <hi>before Philip called thee, I Å¿aw thee under the fig tree,</hi> and he glorifies him with the title of <hi>Son of God, Thou art the Son of God. Thomas</hi> diÅ¿cerns his omnipotence in raiÅ¿ing himÅ¿elf from the dead, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he had foretold, <hi>deÅ¿troy this temple, and I will raiÅ¿e it up in three dayes:</hi> and he attributes the name of <hi>God</hi> to him, <hi>My Lord, and my God.</hi> Had <hi>Thomas</hi> appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended ChriÅ¿t to have been paÅ¿Å¿ive in the reÅ¿urrection, and raiÅ¿ed meerly by the power of the Father, and not his own, why Å¿hould he denominate him <hi>God</hi> upon this
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:48559:71"/> occaÅ¿ion? and not rather put that crown upon the Father, that raiÅ¿ed him, if the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only and not the Son, wrought in it?</p>
               <p n="5">5. The high PrieÅ¿ts, and Scribes, and PhariÅ¿ees thought it to be blaÅ¿phemy alike in ChriÅ¿t when he made himÅ¿elf the Son of God, and made God his natural Father, as when he made himÅ¿elf God; as they truly collected from thoÅ¿e words of his, <hi>I and my Father are one.</hi> Compare <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 18. with <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 31, 33. and the truth of this wil appear. And they made account when he Å¿tiled himÅ¿elf <hi>the Son of God,</hi> that he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in aÅ¿Å¿umed to himÅ¿elf equality with God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 18. and in that they counted it blaÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy that he called himÅ¿elf <hi>the Son of God,</hi> and judged him worthy to die for it, they diÅ¿covered their apprehenÅ¿ions of that title, that it was too high for any creature, and proper to the moÅ¿t high God alone.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Satan alÅ¿o in tempting of him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a proof of his Å¿on-Å¿hip unto God, equall and equivalent to what he could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for the manifeÅ¿tation of the very God-head it Å¿elf: and he muÅ¿t declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe to be the Son of God, by doing that which none but God could do.</p>
               <p>TheÅ¿e grounds I conceive are Å¿ufficient to bottom the firÅ¿t concluÅ¿ion upon, <hi>viz.</hi> that theÅ¿e two expreÅ¿Å¿ions or titles, <hi>Son of</hi>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:48559:72"/> 
                  <hi>God, and God</hi> are in Scripture account equivalent to each other, and do import when they are applyed to ChriÅ¿t a divine perÅ¿on, and the Å¿econd in the order of the Trinity. The conÅ¿equence of which is, that who ever denyes the one, denyes the other alÅ¿o; and then if the <hi>God-head</hi> of ChriÅ¿t be denyed, the Son-Å¿hip of ChriÅ¿t will be denyed alÅ¿o.</p>
               <p>I Å¿hall now lay downe the 2d poÅ¿ition, and confirme it.</p>
               <p>2 ChriÅ¿t cannot be God any other way or under any other conÅ¿ideration, but as he is the Son of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1 He himÅ¿elfe, in his Å¿enÅ¿e, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth the truth of this aÅ¿Å¿ertion; for, he grants a <hi>God-head</hi> of ChriÅ¿t, and makes him a repreÅ¿entative God, and Å¿aith, his <hi>God-head</hi> conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in Å¿overaign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and dominion over all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: and he founds it upon Son-Å¿hip, and Å¿aith, the title <hi>Son of God</hi> holds forth Å¿uperiority over all things, and Å¿o he is God in that he is the Son of God; but all amounts to no more but a creature God, and a creature Son of God, according to him. Yet he concurrs with me in this propoÅ¿ition, though in a different Å¿enÅ¿e, ChriÅ¿t cannot be God any other way then as he is the Son of God.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:48559:72"/> 2. Scripture gives teÅ¿timony to it. 1. The ApoÅ¿tle <hi>Paul</hi> declares to us that <hi>God was manifeÅ¿ted in the fleÅ¿h.</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 16. that is, God aÅ¿Å¿umed the fleÅ¿h of the Virgin; God <hi>took the Å¿eed of Abraham;</hi> God united our Nature with the Divine Nature; God took it into fellowÅ¿hip and oneneÅ¿s with himÅ¿elf, Å¿o as that God and man became one and the Å¿ame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on. And this the ApoÅ¿tle calls <hi>a great myÅ¿tery,</hi> and founds all godlineÅ¿s upon it, that is upon knowing it, and believing it. And Å¿o ChriÅ¿t comes to be God, hath the Names, Titles, Attributes of God put upon him; and the great works of God are called his works; and the homage, worÅ¿hip, Å¿ervice, faith, fear, and obedience that is due to God, belongs to him. OtherwiÅ¿e it could not have been, that he that appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>the form of a Å¿ervant,</hi> and was <hi>in faÅ¿hion as a man,</hi> and <hi>dwelt among us,</hi> and whoÅ¿e mother was known who Å¿he was, and was <hi>in all things like unto us, Å¿in excepted,</hi> Å¿hould be the God that made us, and he in whom our life and breath, and all our ways are: but Å¿o it was, that the great God emptied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf, Å¿o far, as to unite himÅ¿elf to us, or us rather to himÅ¿elf, and to dwell in our nature, and made our nature to dwell in him; and Å¿o he became one with us, and made us, that is, our Nature, one with him: And Å¿o the Son of <hi>Mary</hi> is very God, the moÅ¿t high God, becauÅ¿e God deÅ¿cended, and was made fleÅ¿h of a woman.</p>
               <p>2. There is a concurrence of witneÅ¿Å¿es in the Å¿acred Scriptures, that God took fleÅ¿h; but not God in the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:48559:73"/> perÅ¿on of the Father, nor God in the perÅ¿on of the Spirit, but God in the perÅ¿on of the Son: <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>The Word was made fleÅ¿h, and dwelt among us;</hi> and this <hi>Word</hi> is neither the Father, nor the holy GhoÅ¿t, but is diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed from both, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>There are three that bear witneÅ¿s in heaven; the Father, the Word and the Spirit; and theÅ¿e three are one;</hi> that is, one God. But this one God, in the perÅ¿on of the Word, and not in any other perÅ¿on, took fleÅ¿h up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. The Father did not take FleÅ¿h, but Å¿ent the Son to aÅ¿Å¿ume it: <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>God,</hi> that is, the Father, <hi>Å¿ent forth his Son made of a woman.</hi> Joh. 3. 16. <hi>God,</hi> that is, the Father, <hi>Å¿o loved the world that he gave his own Son, his onely begotten Son,</hi> &amp;c. And all along in the new TeÅ¿tament, the Son is Å¿aid to be <hi>Å¿ent,</hi> Å¿ometimes from God, Å¿ometimes from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Å¿ometimes from heaven: And of the Son it is Å¿aid in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14, that <hi>he took part of fleÅ¿h and blood:</hi> and verÅ¿. 6. <hi>He took on him the Å¿eed of Abraham:</hi> and of the Son it is Å¿aid, that <hi>he was in the form of God, and thought it no robbery to be equal with God,</hi> that is, with the Father; <hi>but he humbled himÅ¿elf, and took upon him the form of a Å¿ervant;</hi> that is, he took upon him our vile, weak, mortal, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nature, and came in lowe Å¿tate among us. And indeed, in this there is no difference betwixt us: But who this Son of God is, is the controverÅ¿ie.</p>
               <p>The inference then muÅ¿t needs be this, that ChriÅ¿t is not God any other way, nor in any other Å¿ence, but this: The Son of God, or (which is all one) God in the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48559:73"/> perÅ¿on of the Son aÅ¿Å¿umed Humane nature unto him, became Man, by taking the fleÅ¿h of the Virgin. And this Son of God, or God in the perÅ¿on of the Son made fleÅ¿h, is the ChriÅ¿t, the MeÅ¿Å¿iah, that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿ed to the fathers: And ChriÅ¿t, he is this fleÅ¿h this Å¿eed of the woman, aÅ¿Å¿umed, and this Son of God, or God in the perÅ¿on of the Son, united together into one perÅ¿on. So that whoever denies ChriÅ¿t to be God, denies that God in the perÅ¿on of the Son; or (which is the Å¿ame) that the Son of God took fleÅ¿h came in our Nature; and that God Å¿ent his Son into the world, to take the Å¿eed of <hi>Abraham</hi> upon him, and to come in fleÅ¿h; and Å¿o denies ChriÅ¿t to be God in the perÅ¿on of the Son, or ChriÅ¿t to be the Son of God. And Å¿o by an undeniable conÅ¿equence, Å¿uch a perÅ¿on who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the Godhead, denies the SonÅ¿hip, and Å¿o deÅ¿troys the true ChriÅ¿t, and brings in a Å¿trange and a falÅ¿e ChriÅ¿t, and another GoÅ¿pel, and another Scripture. And this is the doctrine that the ApoÅ¿tle <hi>John</hi> Å¿peaks of, 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. which Å¿educers preached, who confeÅ¿Å¿ed not that JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t was come in the fleÅ¿h: the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is they confeÅ¿Å¿ed not that the Son of God or God in the perÅ¿on of the Son, was come in the fleÅ¿h: for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiÅ¿e they knew that JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t the Å¿on of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> was in the fleÅ¿h, and died, and roÅ¿e again: But to confeÅ¿s that JeÅ¿us was the Son of God, or God in the perÅ¿on of the Son, was that which the ApoÅ¿tle preÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed; and withÅ¿tood the contrary, as AntichriÅ¿tian, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 14, 15.</p>
               <p>And now give me leave to expreÅ¿s my Å¿elf to
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:48559:74"/> be one who Å¿tand amazed at the ignorance or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iderateneÅ¿s (or I know not what to call it) of thoÅ¿e perÅ¿ons who profeÅ¿s to be very Å¿ound in the doctrine of ChriÅ¿ts Godhead, but conceive of it as a very to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable errour, in Å¿uch who do deny it, and make Å¿light of it. Is it a Å¿mall thing to deny ChriÅ¿t to be the Son of God? ThoÅ¿e that deny ChriÅ¿ts Godhead, do deny God in the perÅ¿on of the Son, to have taken the nature of man upon him: or, they do deny the Son of God to be incarnate, and by conÅ¿equence they do deny ChriÅ¿t to be Gods Son. For do they not know, (I Å¿peak of thoÅ¿e that have not denied the Faith) if ChriÅ¿t be God, he can be God no other way, but becauÅ¿e God in the perÅ¿on of the Son, or the Son of God, took fleÅ¿h upon him: if ChriÅ¿t be Gods Son, he can be Gods Son no other way, but becauÅ¿e God in the perÅ¿on of the Son hath come in the fleÅ¿h; and if this be denied, it is denied that ChriÅ¿t is Gods Son. And is this a trivial matter? ChriÅ¿t conÅ¿iÅ¿ts of two Natures; of Humanity, and Å¿o he is the Son of man; of the Deity, and Å¿o he is the Son of God, as I have Å¿hewed. Can ChriÅ¿t be a true ChriÅ¿t, if either of theÅ¿e be wanting? A Man conÅ¿iÅ¿ts of Å¿oul and body: if either of theÅ¿e be wanting, can he be a true man? If the Å¿oul be wanting, (which is the principal part) is he any more then a Å¿tinking carcaÅ¿e?) If ChriÅ¿t be not the Son of God, (as, if he be not God, he is not) is he any other but a carcaÅ¿e-ChriÅ¿t? Can a thing have its truth of being, without its conÅ¿titutive parts by which it is? So that ChriÅ¿t is deÅ¿troyed,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48559:74"/> unlels the Son of God, and the Son of Man, united together in one perÅ¿on, be maintained.</p>

               <p>The Major is indubitable; the Minor may be thus proved:</p>

               <p>Therefore, this Doctrine of his doth deÅ¿troy the Faith of a ChriÅ¿tian.</p>
               <p>The Major cannot reaÅ¿onably be denied, becauÅ¿e Faith is true and Å¿aving from the object that it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿ant about; as Å¿uppoÅ¿e it Å¿hould be <hi>Baal</hi> in Å¿tead of the true God; Å¿uppoÅ¿e it Å¿hould be <hi>Mahomet</hi> in Å¿tead of ChriÅ¿t; or Å¿uppoÅ¿e it Å¿hould be a falÅ¿e or counterfeit ChriÅ¿t, in Å¿tead of the true ChriÅ¿t: that
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:48559:75"/> faith that is carried out to Å¿uch an object, could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be true nor Å¿aving.</p>
               <p>The Minor may be thus confirmed:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>That Doctrine that denies ChriÅ¿t to be the Son of God takes away the principal object of the faith of ChriÅ¿tians.</item>

               </list>
               <p>The Major hath an infallible truth in it: for the Scripture makes ChriÅ¿t to be principally the object of a ChriÅ¿tians faith, as he is the Son of God. 1. It hath its denomination from this object; it is called <hi>the faith of the Son of God</hi> Gal. 2. 20. 2. ChriÅ¿t propoÅ¿eth himÅ¿elf, as he is the Son of God, to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved on: Å¿o to the blinde man (whoÅ¿e eyes he had opened) <hi>DoÅ¿t thou believe the Son of God,</hi> Å¿aid ChriÅ¿t? <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 35. Under that conÅ¿ideration, as Å¿uch a perÅ¿on he preÅ¿ented himÅ¿elf as an adequate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his faith for Å¿alvation. 3. The primitive Saints mentioned in Scripture, in their ConfeÅ¿Å¿ions of Faith, do point their Faith, and terminate it upon ChriÅ¿t, the Son of God. In <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. 27, <hi>Martha</hi> Å¿aid, <hi>Lord, I believe that thou art ChriÅ¿t the Son of God.</hi> The Eunuch alÅ¿o being put upon the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his faith, did pitch it upon, and carried it out to this object, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 37. <hi>I believe that JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t is the Son of God.</hi> It Å¿hould Å¿eem that <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> had held him forth in the excellency and glory of
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:48559:75"/> his perÅ¿on <hi>as the Son of God,</hi> and had preached him under that relation as the object of Å¿aving faith, and that thereupon the Eunuch received him as Å¿uch, and believed. But before theÅ¿e, the ApoÅ¿tles themÅ¿elves, that were bred up under ChriÅ¿t, and were inÅ¿tructed by ChriÅ¿t, they grounded their faith upon ChriÅ¿t as he was the Son of the living God, in <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 69. <hi>We believe and are Å¿ure that thou art ChriÅ¿t the Son of the living God.</hi> 4. ChriÅ¿t makes himÅ¿elf, as he is <hi>the Son of God,</hi> the foundation of ChriÅ¿tians, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which their faith muÅ¿t bottom; and this Article of Faith, <hi>Thou art ChriÅ¿t the Son of the living God,</hi> he makes the Rock upon which he will build his <hi>Church;</hi> and the gates of hell Å¿hall never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againÅ¿t it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 16. And he placeth true bleÅ¿Å¿edneÅ¿s in it. I could wiÅ¿h that all perÅ¿ons that are right in their opinion of ChriÅ¿ts Godhead, and yet plead againÅ¿t the fundamentalneÅ¿s of the errour of denying the Godhead, would but ponder what is here preÅ¿ented, and take it up in its full weight and Å¿trength. They that hold ChriÅ¿t to be God, muÅ¿t needs do it upon this account, becauÅ¿e God in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on of the Son, or the Son of God, which is the Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond perÅ¿on in the Trinity, took fleÅ¿h upon him, and became man; and that hence it is that this man, and this Å¿econd perÅ¿on in the Godhead, or this Son of God, make up one ChriÅ¿t, and that ChriÅ¿t is hereupon juÅ¿tly Å¿tiled <hi>the Son of God,</hi> or <hi>the Å¿econd perÅ¿on in the Godhead.</hi> And if it be alÅ¿o clear from Scripture, that faith in ChriÅ¿t is onely Å¿ound and Å¿aving, as it
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:48559:76"/> hath ChriÅ¿t conÅ¿idered as he is the Son of God, or the Å¿econd perÅ¿on in the Godhead, for the object of it; then what can that Doctrine be leÅ¿s then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tructively dangerous, and Å¿ubverting the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of ChriÅ¿tianity, that denies that there is any Å¿uch God in the perÅ¿on of the Son, or any Å¿uch Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond perÅ¿on in the Godhead called the Son, or that there is any Å¿uch Son of God, who is God; Å¿uch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons conÅ¿equently cannot have their Faith carried out after any Å¿uch Son of God, who is God, but after a Creature-Å¿on of God, which is totally another thing from that Son of God which Scripture preÅ¿ents to us: And what can be thought of thoÅ¿e that hold Å¿uch Doctrine, but that they have left the Rock, the Foundation upon which Believers are built unto the Å¿alvation of their Å¿ouls; and that they build upon the Å¿and, and that their Å¿tate threatens certain ruine?</p>
               <p>But the Minor will be that PropoÅ¿ition which he will deny; <hi>viz.</hi> That this Doctrine of his which makes whole ChriÅ¿t a creature, doth deny ChriÅ¿t to be the Son of God.</p>
               <p>I have proved this PropoÅ¿ition in my proÅ¿ecution of the former Argument; to which I might refer the Reader: but for further Å¿atisfaction I Å¿hall make choice of another <hi>medium,</hi> and by it prove that this his Doctrine denies ChriÅ¿t to be the Son of God.</p>
               <p>That Doctrine that makes ChriÅ¿t a creature-Å¿on of God, denies ChriÅ¿t to be the true Son of God.</p>
               <p>But this Doctrine of his makes ChriÅ¿t to be onely a creature-Å¿on of God:</p>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:48559:76"/>
               <p> Therefore this Doctrine of his denies ChriÅ¿t to be the true Son of God.</p>
               <p>The Major PropoÅ¿ition is that which will onely be denied by him; therefore I Å¿hall prove out of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that ChriÅ¿t cannot be a creature-Å¿on of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The eternal Son of God cannot be a creature-Å¿on of God, becauÅ¿e no creature is eternal. Or thus:</p>
               <p>That Son of God that hath neither <hi>beginning of days, nor end of life,</hi> cannot be a creature-Å¿on of God, becauÅ¿e it is the moÅ¿t high God's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty to be without beginning or ending.</p>
               <p>But ChriÅ¿t is Å¿uch a Son of God, which is without beginning of days, and hath no end of life; which is evident from <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 3. <hi>Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dek</hi> is deÅ¿cribed to have neither <hi>beginning of days, nor end of life;</hi> and therein (as a type onely) to be like the Son of God, or like GhriÅ¿t as he is the Son of God: by which it appears, that ChriÅ¿t is Å¿uch a Son of God as is truely eternal, without beginning or ending. For it behoves that which is the Antitype, or the thing typified, to be that in truth, which the Type is in Å¿hadow. <hi>Melchizedek</hi> was in figure and in myÅ¿terie without beginning of days and end of life; ChriÅ¿t muÅ¿t therefore really and truely be without beginning and end, becauÅ¿e he, as the Son of God<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> was the perÅ¿on whom <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek</hi> typified herein.</p>
               <p>Therefore, he is no creature-Å¿on of God.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:48559:77"/> 2. The Almighty Son of God cannot be a creature-Å¿on of God, becauÅ¿e <hi>AlmightineÅ¿s</hi> is one of the moÅ¿t high God's incommunicable attributes.</p>
               <p>But ChriÅ¿t is Å¿uch a Son of God as is Almighty:</p>
               <p>Therefore, no creature-Å¿on of God.</p>
               <p>That ChriÅ¿t is Å¿uch a Son of God as is God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, will be proved from Scripture. In <hi>Mat.</hi> 14. 32. 33, conÅ¿idered with the context, the windes were boiÅ¿terous and tempeÅ¿tous: by the vertue and power of ChriÅ¿t, (which was inherent in him, and which he was the Å¿ubject of) they ceaÅ¿ed. Hereupon, the diÅ¿ciples all of them worÅ¿hipped him, and confeÅ¿Å¿ed that he was the Son of God, that is, one Almighty, whom the windes and the Å¿ea obeyed; and this they made to be the Son of God: for they apprehended the Son of God to be Å¿uch an one who was cloathed with Å¿uch power. So in <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 33, 34, <hi>John</hi> knew not ChriÅ¿t who he was; but the Father told him that he <hi>on whom the holy GhoÅ¿t Å¿hould deÅ¿cend, Å¿hould baptize with the holy GhoÅ¿t.</hi> Hence <hi>John</hi> collected, that he was the Son of God; and the text Å¿aith, <hi>he bare record of it.</hi> God had not told him Å¿o, but onely that <hi>he Å¿hould baptize with the holy GhoÅ¿t;</hi> but he thence collected Å¿o much. But how could that be, Å¿eeing the diÅ¿ciples baptized with the holy GhoÅ¿t; and yet it could not be collected that they were each of them the Son of God in the Å¿ence that <hi>John</hi> bare record of ChriÅ¿t, that he was the Son-of God? It muÅ¿t be conceived then, that <hi>John</hi> look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon ChriÅ¿t as one in whom the power was inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:48559:77"/> baptize with the holy GhoÅ¿t, and that he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued after this manner. He in whom the vertue, is to baptize with the holy GhoÅ¿t; that is, he who hath the power of enabling men to Å¿peak with Å¿trange tongues, and to propheÅ¿ie, and to work miraculouÅ¿ly, he muÅ¿t needs be the Son of God. But ChriÅ¿t is Å¿uch an one: Therefore, he is the Son of God. The Son of God which <hi>John</hi> Å¿peaks of, is therefore an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Son of God, and no creature, becauÅ¿e he can do Å¿uch a thing, that requireth an Almighty power. In like manner we may read in <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 25. ChriÅ¿t Å¿aith, that <hi>the dead Å¿hall hear the voice of the Son of God, and that they that hear it Å¿hall live.</hi> This Son of God then can be no creature, becauÅ¿e the dead in any Å¿ence cannot hear the voice of a creature. It is not to be denied, but that men have raiÅ¿ed the dead, in what Å¿ence Å¿oever it may be taken, who are but creatures: but it was not the outward voice which raiÅ¿ed them, and which they heard, which external voice is the creatures voice; but it was the power that they felt, which was God's, which is called the <hi>voice behinde them,</hi> or within them, and is nothing but the power of God in working upon them, <hi>IÅ¿a.</hi> 30. 21. But the voice by the force of which theÅ¿e dead which ChriÅ¿t Å¿peaks of were to be raiÅ¿ed, was the voice of the Son of God; it was ChriÅ¿t's own voice, ChriÅ¿t's own power, by which they were to be raiÅ¿ed; elÅ¿e ChriÅ¿t declared neither any new thing, nor Å¿trange thing, to cauÅ¿e them to believe on him, becauÅ¿e many others as inÅ¿truments might utter Å¿uch a voice. And the
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:48559:78"/> following verÅ¿e clears it, that by the voice of the Son of God, the power of the Son of God is meant: <hi>As the Father</hi> (Å¿aith ChriÅ¿t) <hi>hath life in himÅ¿elf, Å¿o hath he given to the Son to have life in himÅ¿elf.</hi> The meaning is, that as the Father is the living God, and hath life in himÅ¿elf eÅ¿Å¿entially, and is the root of life, to quicken the dead that are without life: Å¿o the Son hath life in himÅ¿elf eÅ¿Å¿entially, and is the principle of life to others that are dead, and want it. And if this were not Å¿o, there could not be the Å¿trength of a ReaÅ¿on to confirm the foregoing verÅ¿e. ChriÅ¿t had Å¿aid, <hi>They that hear the voice of the Son of God, Å¿hall live.</hi> How doth he prove it? Thus: <hi>As the Father hath life in himÅ¿elf;</hi> that is, As the Father is all life, eÅ¿Å¿entially life, and the principle of life, to quicken whom he will by his mighty power: Å¿o the Son hath life in himÅ¿elf, (though it be communicated with his eÅ¿Å¿ence by eternal generation, which is Å¿utable to a Son) and is eÅ¿Å¿entially life, all life, and nothing elÅ¿e; and is the principle of life, quickning, by that life in himÅ¿elf, whom he will. I Å¿hall preÅ¿ent one Scripture more, in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>For this purpoÅ¿e the Son of God was manifeÅ¿ted, that he might deÅ¿troy the works of the devil.</hi> This phraÅ¿e, <hi>the Son of God was manifeÅ¿ted,</hi> is a parallel-phraÅ¿e with that in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>God manifeÅ¿ted in the fleÅ¿h.</hi> This God was God in the perÅ¿on of the Son, who was manifeÅ¿ted in the fleÅ¿h, that is, took the fleÅ¿h of a Virgin upon him, and became man. For what end? The ApoÅ¿tle Å¿hews, <hi>that he might deÅ¿troy</hi> (that is,
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:48559:78"/> in man's nature might do it) <hi>the works of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi> The Son of God deÅ¿troyed; but by whoÅ¿e power deÅ¿troyed he the works of the devil? By his own power: he is called one that is <hi>Å¿tronger</hi> then the devil, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 12. And if it had not been done by his own power, there was no neceÅ¿Å¿ity that the Son of God Å¿hould have been manifeÅ¿ted in the fleÅ¿h for that purpoÅ¿e: for the Son of man might have done it as an InÅ¿trument, as the DiÅ¿ciples caÅ¿t out de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils; (which was one of the works of Satan that was deÅ¿troyed; his work was to poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿s bodies, as well as Å¿ouls; and he was caÅ¿t out; which was the deÅ¿truction of that work:) but the vertue by which they caÅ¿t out, was none of theirs, but ChriÅ¿ts; but ChriÅ¿t's vertue was his own: for, as one Å¿tronger, he Å¿poiled Satan of all he had, and deÅ¿troyed all his works; wherein the AlmightineÅ¿s of ChriÅ¿t is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿t. And Å¿o it appears that ChriÅ¿t is Å¿uch a Son of God that is Almighty, and Å¿o conÅ¿equently no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Å¿on.</p>
               <list>

               </list>
               <p>The Major is clear, becauÅ¿e OmniÅ¿ciencie is like Omnipotencie; it is incommunicable to the creature, being one of Gods attributes.</p>
               <p>The Minor may be proved from <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 18, 23. The words are: <hi>Thus Å¿aith the Son of God, who</hi>
                  <pb n="558" facs="tcp:48559:79"/> 
                  <hi>hath his eyes like a flame of fire,</hi> that is, to give light to him in all the world, by which he may Å¿ee all things. Therefore it is added. <hi>And all the Churches Å¿hall know that I am he that Å¿earcheth the heart, and trieth the reins, and giveth to every one according to his works.</hi> ChriÅ¿t Å¿peaketh of himÅ¿elf, as the Son of God, and Å¿hews what a Son he is; Å¿uch a Son that is equal to his Father, who can Å¿earch as deep, and inward, and hidden things as the Father can: he hath his Fathers eyes, his Fathers knowledge, wiÅ¿dom, and underÅ¿tanding. It is the one onely God's priviledge and prerogative, to Å¿earch the heart, as I have proved from <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 9, 10. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; and yet ChriÅ¿t as the Son of God, doth it: Therefore he is no creature-Å¿on, but Å¿uch a Son as is the one onely God alÅ¿o.</p>
               <p>The fourth Argument, that carries on the Å¿ame deÅ¿igne, <hi>viz.</hi> tends to prove this Doctrine of his againÅ¿t the Godhead of ChriÅ¿t to be deÅ¿tructive to the GoÅ¿pel in Å¿ome main point of it, is this:</p>

               <pb n="559" facs="tcp:48559:79"/>
               <p> The Major cannot be gainÅ¿aid, becauÅ¿e BaptiÅ¿m is numbered among the higheÅ¿t Fundamentals of the Scripture, to be believed; the denying of which, will deÅ¿troy, if any thing will deÅ¿troy: <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 5, 6. <hi>One Lord, one Faith, one BaptiÅ¿m; one God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all.</hi> And it is called a <hi>principle,</hi> Heb. 6. 1, 2. And becauÅ¿e the fruit of ChriÅ¿t's death, which Å¿tands in remiÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿ins, is the myÅ¿tical and Å¿piritual part of BaptiÅ¿m, <hi>Acts</hi> 22. 16. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21.</p>
               <p>The Minor PropoÅ¿ition may be thus corroborated and confirmed.</p>
               <p>That Doctrine that brings in a BaptiÅ¿m which is into the Name of a meer creature, Å¿ubverts and deÅ¿troys true Scriptural BaptiÅ¿m, and brings in a falÅ¿e unÅ¿criptural BaptiÅ¿m.</p>
               <p>But this Doctrine of his, which makes whole ChriÅ¿t a creature, doth bring in or Å¿et up a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiÅ¿m which is into the Name of a meer crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Therefore, this Doctrine of his Å¿ubverts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿troys true Scriptural BaptiÅ¿m.</p>
               <p>I Å¿hall Å¿trengthen both PropoÅ¿itions, becauÅ¿e per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he will deny both; and will begin with the proof of the Major, <hi>viz.</hi> that to baptize into the Name of a meer creature, deÅ¿troys true BaptiÅ¿m, and Å¿ets up a falÅ¿e.</p>
               <p n="1">1. BecauÅ¿e the true Scriptural BaptiÅ¿m is the Seal of a Covenant, betwixt that one true God, and the believer that partakes of it; in which the believer conÅ¿ecrates and gives up himÅ¿elf to believe on, and
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:48559:80"/> be Å¿ervant to the true God: God and the believer are the confederates. The believer is not confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with any creature: As he gives not himÅ¿elf up to the creature, Å¿o neither can any creature accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliÅ¿h for him thoÅ¿e great bleÅ¿Å¿ings of the Covenant; but he depends upon God alone for them. The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant which is Å¿ealed, is the Covenant of Grace, by which we are Å¿aved.</p>
               <p n="2">2. BecauÅ¿e true GoÅ¿pel-BaptiÅ¿m is the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Adoption, which reÅ¿pects the true God alone: for in BaptiÅ¿m, the Name of God is named upon the believer, and the believer carries God's Name upon him. And this the ApoÅ¿tle <hi>Paul</hi> doth point at, when he reproves the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for calling themÅ¿elves by the name of <hi>Paul,</hi> Å¿aying, <hi>I am of Paul.</hi> The Argument that he makes uÅ¿e of againÅ¿t them, is this: <hi>Were you baptized into the name of Paul?</hi> As if he Å¿hould have Å¿aid; His Name ye bear, and his children ye are, into whoÅ¿e Name ye were baptized: but were ye baptized into the name of <hi>Paul,</hi> that you will carry his name?

               <p n="3">3. BecauÅ¿e true GoÅ¿pel-BaptiÅ¿m is the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of the believers Å¿ubjection unto Divine Soveraignty, or the authority of the moÅ¿t high God: for by <hi>Name,</hi> Authority is frequently underÅ¿tood:
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48559:80"/> to do a thing in the Name of any Prince, or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, or State, is to do in the Vertue, Power, and Authority of them; and to baptize in the Name, is to baptize in the Authority of God, whoÅ¿e Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance it is, and from whom the bleÅ¿Å¿ing muÅ¿t come.</p>
               <p>And for Å¿uch-like reaÅ¿ons as theÅ¿e, it was, that the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿hunned and declined baptizing into his own name: he looked upon it as Å¿acrilegious to God, and an uÅ¿urping upon God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 14, 15. <hi>I thank God</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>I baptized none of you, Å¿ave CriÅ¿pus and Gaius, leÅ¿t any Å¿hould Å¿ay that I ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized into mine own name.</hi> Thus jealous was <hi>Paul,</hi> leÅ¿t he Å¿hould aÅ¿Å¿ume and arrogate to himÅ¿elf that which is the prerogative of, and is proper to God.</p>
               <p>The Minor PropoÅ¿ition, <hi>viz.</hi> That this Doctrine of his, which makes whole ChriÅ¿t a creature, doth bring in, and Å¿et up, a BaptiÅ¿m which is into the name of a meer creature, carries evidence in it Å¿elf, becauÅ¿e BaptiÅ¿m is an Ordinance that (without contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) is into the Name of ChriÅ¿t, and conÅ¿equently into the name of a meer creature, if whole ChriÅ¿t be a creature.</p>
               <p>Object.</p>
               <p>All that (I can foreÅ¿ee) can be alleadged by him againÅ¿t this, is, That BaptiÅ¿m is principally into the Name of the Father; and that it is through ChriÅ¿t, as an inÅ¿trument through whom the Father doth beÅ¿tow the bleÅ¿Å¿ings of BaptiÅ¿m.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> But, 1. How doth Scripture juÅ¿tifie this? where doth it give witneÅ¿s to it? If not, it is not
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:48559:81"/> derogatory to ChriÅ¿t to imagine it. 2. Why doth ChriÅ¿t joyn himÅ¿elf and the Spirit with the Father, as three aÅ¿Å¿ociates, without any Å¿hadow of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or diÅ¿parity; whoÅ¿e PerÅ¿ons are three, but whoÅ¿e Name is but one? It is not Å¿aid, Names, but Name: for as their EÅ¿Å¿ence is one, Å¿o their Name is one; as they are one Lord, Å¿o their Name is one. 3. BaptiÅ¿m hath been into the Name of the Lord JeÅ¿us alone, without the mention of the Father at all, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 5. <hi>When they heard this, they were baptized into the Name of the Lord JeÅ¿us.</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiÅ¿m did run in Å¿uch a form, as that Å¿ometimes the Name of ChriÅ¿t was onely uÅ¿ed, and the Father and the holy GhoÅ¿t were wholly Å¿ilenced, but never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. And can it be conceived, that if the Name of the Father be the Name of that perÅ¿on which is principal, and the Name of the Son be the Name of a perÅ¿on that is onely inÅ¿trumental, that in the form of BaptiÅ¿m, or words of inÅ¿titution, the Name of the principal perÅ¿on Å¿hould be pretermitted, and and the name of the Name of the inÅ¿trument men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned? There is neither Sence, nor ReaÅ¿on, nor Pattern, nor Example for it.</p>
               <p>Object.</p>
               <p>But it may be objected, That <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> was but an inÅ¿trument in that BaptiÅ¿m of <hi>the cloud<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
                  </hi> and of the <hi>Å¿ea,</hi> that is Å¿poken of in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2. and yet it is Å¿aid, that <hi>they were all baptized into Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es, in the cloud, and in the Å¿ea.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sol. MoÅ¿es</hi> is not to be conÅ¿idered as an InÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but as a Type of ChriÅ¿t, who was preÅ¿ent
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:48559:81"/> with the children of <hi>IÅ¿rael</hi> in the pillar of the cloud, and in the pillar of fire: and they were baptized into <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> myÅ¿tically, and figuratively, as into the Type; but really and truely they were baptized in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ChriÅ¿t, who was the Antitype, and in whom that which was in Å¿hadow in reference to <hi>MoÅ¿es,</hi> was in Å¿ubÅ¿tance, and was fulfilled, in reference unto ChriÅ¿t, as hath been demonÅ¿trated before.</p>
               <p>For further conviction, becauÅ¿e I diÅ¿cern that Å¿ome are <hi>Å¿lowe of heart to believe</hi> the deÅ¿perateneÅ¿s and damnableneÅ¿s of this Doctrine, I Å¿hall propound another Argument to prove the deÅ¿tructiveneÅ¿s of this his Tenent to the GoÅ¿pel, and Scriptures, in Å¿ome main points of them.</p>

               <p>But this Doctrine of his, which makes whole ChriÅ¿t a creature, doth deny ChriÅ¿t to be the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Å¿alvation, and makes him onely an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trument in the hand of the Father, who is the author:</p>
               <p>Therefore, this Doctrine of his denies ChriÅ¿t to be a Å¿ufficient Saviour.</p>
               <p>He may perhaps deny the Major, and diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h of Å¿ufficiencie, and Å¿ay there is an abÅ¿olute and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Å¿ufficiencie, which is proper to that which is the author of a thing; and there is a limited and reÅ¿trained Å¿ufficiencie<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> depending upon that abÅ¿olute Å¿ufficiencie of the author, which is Å¿utable and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to an inÅ¿trument; and this later ChriÅ¿t hath, and Å¿o is Å¿ufficient through God, through the Father, for the work of Å¿alvation, though he be but a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>But Å¿uch an AnÅ¿wer muÅ¿t be judged weak, for two ReaÅ¿ons. 1. The Å¿ufficiencie of ChriÅ¿t to Å¿ave, is an abÅ¿olute Å¿ufficiencie, and Å¿uch as is proper to the author of Å¿alvation, according to the teÅ¿timony of the Scripture, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>And being made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, he became the author of eternal Å¿alvation to them that obey him.</hi> Now I hope he will not
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:48559:82"/> confound the Author and the InÅ¿trument, and make them one perÅ¿on. An inÅ¿trumental Å¿ufficiencie the Scripture knows nothing of, in reference to ChriÅ¿t, nor doth attribute any Å¿uch to him. 2. An inÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Å¿ufficiencie is no other then inÅ¿ufficiencie: for an inÅ¿trument is not able to Å¿ave to the utmoÅ¿t, and Å¿o is of himÅ¿elf inÅ¿ufficient to Å¿ave; but ChriÅ¿t is able of himÅ¿elf to <hi>Å¿ave to the utmoÅ¿t,</hi> Heb. 7. 25.</p>
               <p>But he perhaps will endeavour to evade the Å¿trength of this AÅ¿Å¿ertion, by Å¿aying, that if ChriÅ¿t be able, through God the Father, to Å¿ave to the utmoÅ¿t, it is Å¿ufficient for the verifying of Scripture.</p>
               <p>But neither hath this AnÅ¿wer Å¿trength in it, nor is Scripture verified by it: for Scripture Å¿peaks of ChriÅ¿ts ability, as ability in himÅ¿elf; <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3, ChriÅ¿t is deÅ¿cribed to be one that <hi>upholds all things by the word of his</hi> own <hi>power,</hi> and to purge Å¿in away by <hi>himÅ¿elf:</hi> and ChriÅ¿t never needed to Å¿ay of the Father, as <hi>Paul</hi> Å¿aid of ChriÅ¿t, <hi>I am able to do all things through ChriÅ¿t that Å¿trengthneth me;</hi> Å¿o ChriÅ¿t, I am able to do all things through the Father that Å¿trengthens me: and though he might be Å¿treng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened, as the Son of man, yet not as the Son of God; but drew on the people to believe a Divine power in himÅ¿elf: for his words are without any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation. <hi>DoÅ¿t thou believe that I am able to do this for thee?</hi> Å¿aith he to one that came to be cured of him, without interpoÅ¿ing any words which Å¿hould Å¿hew his dependence on another. And this ability was Divine ability, becauÅ¿e it lay in this, <hi>viz.</hi> to
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:48559:83"/> heal without the efficacie of means which might conduce to Å¿uch a purpoÅ¿e. And ChriÅ¿t is called <hi>the power of the Father,</hi> becauÅ¿e the Father's power is in him. And it is Å¿aid that God <hi>laid help upon one that is mighty;</hi> which, though Å¿poken of <hi>David,</hi> yet of him but as the Type; and is meant of ChriÅ¿t, who is the Antitype, and who is truely mighty. This ability of ChriÅ¿t within himÅ¿elf to Å¿ave to the utmoÅ¿t, is that which the ApoÅ¿tle diÅ¿pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for, in many places of that EpiÅ¿tle, and eÅ¿pecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Context of that Scripture, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. <hi>He is able to Å¿ave to the utmoÅ¿t:</hi> for he doth detect the inÅ¿ufficiencie of the High-prieÅ¿t to Å¿ave, by Å¿hewing their mortality, and other infirmities; and then preÅ¿ents ChriÅ¿t's Å¿ufficiencie. And if it were Å¿o that God could have Å¿aved by an inÅ¿trument which derives his vertue from him, and is dependent upon him, a Saviour needed not to have come from heaven; for God might have done it by any earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly creature, or by any creature-inÅ¿trument, without any reÅ¿pect had to power or ability as inherent in it at all, but by his own power manifeÅ¿ted by it; and Å¿o might have Å¿aved by an ApoÅ¿tle, equally as by a ChriÅ¿t.</p>
               <p>But I Å¿hall prove what I deÅ¿igne, by another <hi>medium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That Doctrine which renders ChriÅ¿t inÅ¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to the work of Å¿aving, renders him an inÅ¿ufficient Saviour, or deÅ¿troys his Å¿ufficiencie as a Saviour.</p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:48559:83"/>
               <p> But this Doctrine of his renders ChriÅ¿t inÅ¿ufficient to perform the work of Å¿aving, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which I prove thus:</p>
               <p>If ChriÅ¿t be a meer creature, he is inÅ¿ufficient to execute thoÅ¿e three Offices of King, PrieÅ¿t, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, to perform the work which thoÅ¿e Offices do call for, for the Å¿aving of men.</p>
               <p>I Å¿hall begin with his Prophetical Office, unto the execution of which it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary, not onely to open the Scriptures to men, that they may conceive of them, but to open the underÅ¿tandings of men to underÅ¿tand them; and to give them eye-Å¿alve, that they may Å¿ee: which, becauÅ¿e it belongs to his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice as a Prophet, he muÅ¿t be able to do from vertue and ability within himÅ¿elf. But no creature can ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect this by any power of its own, nor is capable to receive Å¿uch power from another, becauÅ¿e it is not competent to the creature; and conÅ¿equently, ChriÅ¿t being onely a creature (as he holds him) is diÅ¿abled in the principal work of that Office.</p>
               <p>And, as a PrieÅ¿t, he was to offer up himÅ¿elf to God through the eternal Spirit, that he might purge away Å¿in, and that his Blood might be of greater efficacie then the blood of bulls and goats; and that he might purchaÅ¿e eternal redemption for believers: which as a creature he could not do, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 12. So that he diÅ¿ables him in the works of his PrieÅ¿tly Office, in holding him onely to be a creature.</p>
               <p>And, as a King, he muÅ¿t conquer Death, by raiÅ¿ing
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:48559:84"/> himÅ¿elf up from the dead, which he was to Å¿uffer as a PrieÅ¿t, to take away Å¿in. And he muÅ¿t alÅ¿o de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿troy Å¿in in its regnancie by Kingly power, in his members, as he was to condemn it in its guilt by his death: which work is above the power of any meer creature. So that by this opinion of his, he is made weak to perform all his Offices, which yet he came into the world to accompliÅ¿h; and that he is made an inÅ¿ufficient Saviour; which overturns the GoÅ¿pel, in the principal Å¿cope of it. But of this more hereafter.</p>
               <p>The laÅ¿t Argument which I Å¿hall now produce to prove another GoÅ¿pel and Scripture to be brought in, and the true GoÅ¿pel and Scripture to be deÅ¿troy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is this:</p>

               <p>The conÅ¿equence of which is, Whoever denies this myÅ¿tery, denies and deÅ¿troys godlineÅ¿s, and, in Å¿o doing, denies and deÅ¿troys the GoÅ¿pel, which is called by the ApoÅ¿tle, <hi>doctrine which is after god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineÅ¿s,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 3. Tit. 1. 1.</p>
               <p>And this is of weighty conÅ¿ideration to all thoÅ¿e that acknowledge ChriÅ¿t to be God, and yet hold it not very dreadful in thoÅ¿e that do gainÅ¿ay it, but account them Saints and godly perÅ¿ons: which they cannot groundedly do, while the evidence of this text is againÅ¿t them, which Å¿aith. <hi>Great is the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tery of godlineÅ¿s, God manifeÅ¿t in the fleÅ¿h.</hi> And if they acknowledge the truth of this text, then this text will Å¿tare them in the face, while they cry up the godlineÅ¿s of Å¿uch who do oppoÅ¿e it. Where is their godlineÅ¿s, if this myÅ¿terie (which they acknowledge not) be the myÅ¿terie of godlineÅ¿s? If godlineÅ¿s be the fruit of this doctrine, rightly underÅ¿tood &amp; received; if it grow upon the tree of this truth, and they hew down this tree, deÅ¿troy this truth in the opinion which they hold; doth not the fruit fall with it? GodlineÅ¿s is cut down with the tree out of which it grows; it is
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:48559:86"/> plucked up with the root that bears it. What can be Å¿aid againÅ¿t this? Me thinks every tongue Å¿hould be Å¿ilent hence-forward, that Å¿ubÅ¿cribes to this text, <hi>Great is the myÅ¿tery of golineÅ¿s, God manifeÅ¿t in the fleÅ¿h,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But enough hath been Å¿poken of this, to convince any one that loves the Truth, and will open his eyes to receive it.</p>
               <p>I Å¿hall now undertake the maintaining of Å¿uch Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments or InÅ¿tances (as he calls them) which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to Å¿hew the repugnancie of his Doctrine to the GoÅ¿pel, and to the Scripture, and diÅ¿cover the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s and unÅ¿oundneÅ¿s of the AnÅ¿wers that he gives.</p>
               <p>The firÅ¿t Argument or InÅ¿tance, was:</p>

                  <hi>InÅ¿tance</hi> 1. If ChriÅ¿t be but a meer creature, and not God, then the giving of Divine worÅ¿hip, and honour, and Å¿ervice to a meer creature, is lawful, and warrantable; which yet is everywhere forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, in reference to any creature, but is practiÅ¿ed unto ChriÅ¿t, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 12, 13, 14. and would be ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, if ChriÅ¿t were not God.</p>
               <p>He puts this InÅ¿tance into form.</p>
               <p>To give Divine worÅ¿hip, honour and Å¿ervice to a meer creature, is contrary to the Scripture.</p>
               <p>To give Divine worÅ¿hip, honour, and Å¿ervice to ChriÅ¿t, is not contrary to, but by the warrant of Scripture:</p>
               <p>Therefore, ChriÅ¿t is not a meer creature.</p>
               <p>He anÅ¿wers to the Major PropoÅ¿ition, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tinguiÅ¿heth of Divine worÅ¿hip, honour, and Å¿ervice.

               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> But he might as truely Å¿ay, Every war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable action that a man performs, is divine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e it hath God for the principal Author, and ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Centre; that is, it hath God's command for the beginning of it, and God's glory for the end of of it. But by Å¿uch diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hing, he confounds what ought to be diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed; he makes Divine worÅ¿hip and Civil worÅ¿hip to be the Å¿ame thing, becauÅ¿e God is the principal Author and ultimate Centre of them both: but theÅ¿e two have ever been diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed by our Writers, and made oppoÅ¿ite <hi>Å¿pecies</hi> of WorÅ¿hip. Therefore it was very frivolous for him to look upon Divine WorÅ¿hip in that Å¿ence.</p>
               <p>2. He Å¿aith, <hi>But if you mean, in the Å¿tricteÅ¿t Å¿ence, that worÅ¿hip, honour and Å¿ervice which is peculiar to the moÅ¿t high God; then I Å¿hall Å¿ay with you that it is Idolatry; and contrary to the Scriptures, to give it to any creature whatÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> The controverÅ¿ie betwixt us and the PapiÅ¿ts, is, what WorÅ¿hip is peculiar to God, and what is not peculiar but may be given to a creature. And we aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ert againÅ¿t them, that all Divine worÅ¿hip and honor is peculiar to God, and none of it communicable to any meer creature. But he tells us of Å¿ome Divine worÅ¿hip which is peculiar, and of Å¿ome that is not
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:48559:87"/> peculiar. For the better underÅ¿tanding of this Truth, let it be looked into what Divine WorÅ¿hip is, and what the grounds thereof are.</p>
               <p>Divine WorÅ¿hip is that ObÅ¿ervance in which we are carried directly and immediately to God, in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoÅ¿e things that directly bring honour to him, and glorifie him, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 21. <hi>When they knew God they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Cor. 8. 5. <hi>They firÅ¿t gave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves up unto the Lord, and then to us, according to the will of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ground of this WorÅ¿hip or ObÅ¿ervance, is, that excellencie of God, which in his Å¿ufficiencie and efficiencie Å¿hines forth. It is not one attribute or perfection in God, that is the formal and adequate cauÅ¿e and reaÅ¿on of Divine WorÅ¿hip; but it is the concurrence of all infinite perfections and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 6, 7. <hi>The Lord, the Lord God mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful and gracious, long-Å¿uffering, and full of truth</hi> &amp;c. Therefore it is that Å¿ometimes one at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute in God is Å¿aid to ingender homage and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 130. 4. <hi>But there is forgiveneÅ¿s with thee, that thou mayÅ¿t be feared<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
                  </hi> And Å¿ometimes another, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 28, 29. <hi>Let us have grace, whereby we may Å¿erve God with reverence and godly fear. For our God is a conÅ¿uming fire.</hi> And Divine worÅ¿hip is the acknowledgement of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite MajeÅ¿tie, Truth, WiÅ¿dom, GoodneÅ¿s, Glory of the bleÅ¿Å¿ed God.</p>
               <p>Divine WorÅ¿hip hath been wont to be divided
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:48559:88"/> into Natural worÅ¿hip, and InÅ¿tituted worÅ¿hip.</p>
               <p>Natural worÅ¿hip flows from the very knowledge of God, if it be right and true, though there were no Law to impoÅ¿e any Å¿uch thing upon men; and it conÅ¿tÅ¿ts in faith, and love, and fear, and hope, and thankfulneÅ¿s, and in praying unto God, and hearing what God the Lord will Å¿ay to them: for of theÅ¿e, Å¿uch who have a right knowledge of God, will Å¿oon be convinced: <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 9. 10. <hi>They that know thy Name, will truÅ¿t in thee.</hi> And hereto alÅ¿o doth belong Å¿ome natural external acts and poÅ¿tures of the body, which do hold forth the reverence and homage of the minde; as the bowing of the knees, and proÅ¿trating of the body before God.</p>
               <p>InÅ¿tituted worÅ¿hip is certain <hi>mediums</hi> or means, ordained by the will of God, for the putting forth and exerciÅ¿ing of natural worÅ¿hip, <hi>viz.</hi> faith, love, hope, fear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are inward acts of the minde, and graces whereby we gratifie God, and honour him; and belong to Natural worÅ¿hip.</p>
               <p>This InÅ¿tituted worÅ¿hip conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in Ordinances and Services of God's own appointment, in which the Natural worÅ¿hip of faith, hope, fear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are acted, and by which they are promoved.</p>
               <p>Having Å¿hewed what Divine WorÅ¿hip is, and the grounds and kindes of it, it remains that I declare that all Divine WorÅ¿hip, (and not Å¿ome alone, as he aÅ¿Å¿erts) is peculiar to God, and not to be given to any creature, that is no more then a creature.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:48559:88"/> 1. That which is limited and reÅ¿trained by Go to God alone, in the firÅ¿t and Å¿econd Commandment, and inhibited and forbidden to be given to any other, that muÅ¿t needs be peculiar to God alone. But all divine worÅ¿hip, both natural and inÅ¿tituted, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the poÅ¿tures that do attend them, as appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to divine worÅ¿hip, are limited and reÅ¿trained by God to God onely, and prohibited to be given to any other: Therefore it muÅ¿t needs be proper and peculiar to God.</p>
               <p>For what elÅ¿e is the Å¿enÅ¿e of thoÅ¿e two Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; <hi>Thou Å¿halt have no other Gods but me: Thou Å¿halt not make to thy Å¿elf any graven Image,</hi> &amp;c. but an injunction of the having and exerciÅ¿ing Å¿uch divine Graces and Affections upon and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God above, and a Å¿ubmitting to divine dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and inÅ¿tructions from God, in reference to the means of worÅ¿hip, and to him alone? All that hath been written and preached by the moÅ¿t approved, looks this way. They Å¿ay naturall worÅ¿hip is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in the one, and ordained worÅ¿hip in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and he that gives the natural to any but the true God, Å¿ets up and makes to himÅ¿elf another God beÅ¿ide him; and he that Å¿ets up, or Å¿ubmits to any formes of worÅ¿hip, without the dictate or warrant of the true God, commits Idolatry againÅ¿t the true God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That which ChriÅ¿t doth appropriate to God, that muÅ¿t needs be peculiar to him.</p>
               <p>But ChriÅ¿t doth appropriate divine worÅ¿hip to
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:48559:89"/> God alone, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 10. <hi>Thou Å¿halt worÅ¿hip the Lord thy God, and him onely Å¿halt thou Å¿erve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore divine worÅ¿hip is peculiar to God, and may not be given to any other.</p>
               <p>That which the Devil required of ChriÅ¿t, was proÅ¿tration, or bowing his body to the ground before him, in a Religious way; as for his heart, and the faith of it, and love or it, and fear of it, and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it, in any kind or the intention of thoÅ¿e affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he mentions them not, requires them not, nor could he know whether they were given to him, or no, nor in what degree and meaÅ¿ure; but the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward homage onely, in the inclination of the body to the earth, in a religious way; and ChriÅ¿t yeelds not to it, but repels him with the Scripture, which he fetcheth from <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 13. or from Chap. 10. 20. or from Chap. 26. 10. for I find no other that ChriÅ¿t can allude to, and ExpoÅ¿itors do direct to the two former; but in none of them is it Å¿aid. <hi>Him onely Å¿halt thou Å¿erve;</hi> nor is it applyed to external ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: but our Saviour, an infallible expoÅ¿itor, doth extend it to religious poÅ¿tures, and outward homage in a Å¿piritual way, and doth reÅ¿train it to God alone.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That which the ApoÅ¿tle condemned in the <hi>Galatians,</hi> while they were heathen, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be allowable in ChriÅ¿tians.</p>
               <p>But the doing of Religious Å¿ervice, or giving religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or divine worÅ¿hip to them, which by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:48559:89"/> are not Gods, is the thing that the ApoÅ¿tle condemns in the <hi>Galatians,</hi> while they were Heathens, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 8.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is not allowable in ChriÅ¿tians.</p>
               <p>The Heathens when they worÅ¿hipped Å¿tocks and Å¿tones, and works of the hands of the Workman, they did it <hi>relativÃ¨,</hi> not <hi>terminative;</hi> that is, they worÅ¿hipped the higheÅ¿t being in theÅ¿e, and did not ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate and end their worÅ¿hip in theÅ¿e, but uÅ¿ed theÅ¿e as helps in that worÅ¿hip which they directed to the moÅ¿t High God, whom they knew not, and carried their worÅ¿hip through theÅ¿e to him; as from <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 23. compared with 25. 29. will appear. They worÅ¿hipped Idols of Å¿ilver and gold and graven Å¿tone, yet they knew that thoÅ¿e Idols made by mens hands were not God, but there was an unknown God, whom they worÅ¿hipped in Å¿uch Images: Yet this worÅ¿hip was accounted by the ApoÅ¿tle a doing Å¿ervice to them which by nature are not Gods, and was condemned: And this intermediate Å¿ervice which was not terminated in the thing Å¿erved, will not be allowed, as belonging to any other but to him, who is eÅ¿Å¿entially God, and by nature God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That which neither the Angels, nor the moÅ¿t eminent Saints on earth, durÅ¿t accept, though tendred to them, becauÅ¿e they were but creatures, but direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to God as proper onely to him, that ought not to be given to any creature, but is peculiar to God. But divine Religious worÅ¿hip manifeÅ¿ted in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward proÅ¿tration of the body, was a thing that the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:48559:90"/> Angels, and the moÅ¿t eminent Saints, durÅ¿t not accept of, becauÅ¿e they were but creatures; but directed it to God, as proper to him alone: Therefore divine Religious WorÅ¿hip ought not to be given to any meer creature, but is peculiar to God.</p>
               <p>There are many Scriptures which Å¿erve to confirm that which can in reaÅ¿on onely be queÅ¿tioned in this Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether all divine Religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip, though intermediate, and in the loweÅ¿t degree, was rejected by Angels and Saints, as undue to them, and as proper to God: for this purpoÅ¿e, Å¿ee <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 26. where may be found, that Adoration with the body, which did proceed from the eÅ¿timation of the mind, though <hi>Cornelius</hi> that tendred it, knew <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> to whom he tendred it, neither to be God nor ChriÅ¿t; nor had he that eÅ¿teem of him, nor did he terminate that worÅ¿hip which he gave him, upon him; for he was better inÅ¿tructed; but through him looked at God: yet the thing was evil that he did, and undue to <hi>Peter,</hi> or to any meer man whatever, and was therefore rejected by <hi>Peter</hi> upon that ground and account; <hi>Stand up</hi> (Å¿aid he) <hi>for I my Å¿elf am alÅ¿o a man:</hi> as if he Å¿hould have Å¿aid, I am not God, but a man, a meer man, and nothing more; therefore it is not proper to adore me thus.</p>
               <p>So alÅ¿o in <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 10. and chap. 22. 9. <hi>John</hi> fell at the Angel to worÅ¿hip him, knowing him to be but an Angel, and looking upon him only as one through whom he had found favor to have Å¿uch things Å¿hewed him, and as one Å¿uperiour to him, becauÅ¿e an Angel,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:48559:90"/> as <hi>Rev.</hi> 32. 8. Å¿hews, <hi>I fell down at the feet of the Angel that had Å¿hewed me theÅ¿e things;</hi> it was upon this account that he fell down, He was an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, and had Å¿hewed Å¿uch things to him; he was not God, nor ChriÅ¿t, nor did <hi>John</hi> look upon him Å¿o: and it was but an outward proÅ¿trating of his body before him, ariÅ¿ing from that reverent eÅ¿teem that he had of him; yet it was not accepted by the Angel, but repelled and with this Argument repelled, <hi>I am thy fellow-Å¿ervant,</hi> (as indeed the higheÅ¿t creatures are) <hi>and of thy Brethren, that have the teÅ¿timony of JeÅ¿us; Å¿ee therefore thou do it not; worÅ¿hip God.</hi> Whence it is apparent, that the loweÅ¿t degree of Religious divine WorÅ¿hip, is too high for any creature.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That wherein Gods glory lies, and which he is Å¿o dear of that he will not give it to any other, and which when it hath been given to another, by his people, hath Å¿tirred up his jealouÅ¿ie, that muÅ¿t needs be proper and peculiar to God, and is not to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to any other below God. But all divine religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worÅ¿hip is Å¿uch a thing wherein Gods glory lies, and of which God is Å¿o dear, that he will not give it to any other, but proves jealous preÅ¿ently if it be given: Therefore all divine Religious worÅ¿hip is Å¿o proper and peculiar to God, that it is not to be given to another.</p>
               <p>The Scriptures that prove the Minor propoÅ¿ition, which alone may be queÅ¿tioned, are <hi>IÅ¿a.</hi> 42. 8. <hi>I am the Lord, that is my Name, and my glory will I</hi>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:48559:91"/> 
                  <hi>not give to another, nor my praiÅ¿e to a graven Image.</hi> This Glory which God will not give to any other, is Å¿uch worÅ¿hip which was wont to be given to a graven Image, and which the children of <hi>IÅ¿rael</hi> gave to the Calf in <hi>Horeb,</hi> which was intermediate worÅ¿hip, and was not terminated in the Calf, but in God; and yet God would not give that from him. And when God gives the Å¿econd Commandment, in which he forbids to be worÅ¿hipped through an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, (and by Image, any thing that may be thought of to repreÅ¿ent him, is meant, as all confeÅ¿s that have been accounted Orthodox) he mentions his jealouÅ¿ie which will ariÅ¿e in his beÅ¿t, if Å¿uch worÅ¿hip be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him; he will count it as if the Image, the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the repreÅ¿entative, whatever it be, were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hipped, and not he; and he will viÅ¿it that Å¿in upon the Fathers unto their children to many Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>By this time I hope it will be evident unto the Reader, That all divine Religious worÅ¿hip is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to God alone. I Å¿hall now proceed to conÅ¿ider of the reÅ¿idue of his AnÅ¿wer.</p>
               <p>He undertakes to Å¿hew difference betwixt the worÅ¿hip that is peculiar to God, and all other wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip. His words are theÅ¿e:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That worÅ¿hip, honour, Å¿ervice, which is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to God, differs from that which may be yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to a creature, partly in the matter, but wholly in the manner of it. We muÅ¿t pray to God for all things we want, and may pray to men for what</hi>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:48559:91"/> 
                  <hi>they can give; we muÅ¿t obey God, and we muÅ¿t obey men who are Å¿et over us by God: but we may not worÅ¿hip, honour, and Å¿erve men in the like manner as we do the moÅ¿t high God, who is the principal and ultimate object of all worÅ¿hip, honour and Å¿ervice; his right thereto being onely of himÅ¿elf, and he himÅ¿elf being the Å¿ole end thereof. According to this Å¿enÅ¿e, is that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand which our Saviour mentions.</hi> Mat. 4. 10. <hi>Thou Å¿halt worÅ¿hip the Lord thy God, and him onely Å¿halt thou Å¿erve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> In theÅ¿e Lines, he hath multiplyed words, but hath not increaÅ¿ed knowledge; he hath told us of a difference, but hath not Å¿hewed us what it is, he hath inÅ¿tanced in matter and manner, but not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared wherein, in what particulars, in either; he Å¿hewed reaÅ¿ons of a difference, why it muÅ¿t be Å¿o; God is firÅ¿t and laÅ¿t, therefore none muÅ¿t be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hipped as he: but the difference is yet in the dark; I would intreat any one to fetch it out of his words, if he can. And if there be any light in his expreÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that light is darkneÅ¿s, yea blackneÅ¿s of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s: he hath Å¿aid that God is the principal and ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate object of all worÅ¿hip, and Å¿o he leaves it, and therein he opens a dore to all PopiÅ¿h Idolatry; a man may worÅ¿hip a Å¿tock, or a Å¿tone, or any thing, provided that God be the firÅ¿t and the laÅ¿t, the principal and ultimate object in that worÅ¿hip that he gives thereto. What would any PapiÅ¿t deÅ¿ire more at his hands? A graven Image may be an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:48559:92"/> of his worÅ¿hip, if it be not the principal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, nor the ultimate, but that he paÅ¿s through it to God.</p>
               <p>As for the difference in matter, he mentioned it, and then deÅ¿erted it, without giving the leaÅ¿t hint what it is. It had been needful that he Å¿hould have pitched upon Å¿ome act or acts of worÅ¿hip of which it might have been Å¿aid. This act is Å¿o proper and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to God (materially conÅ¿idered) as that the like material act may not be performed to any that is not God: But he foreÅ¿aw that the giving of an inÅ¿tance herein, would have loÅ¿t the cauÅ¿e he pleads for: for though he might have given inÅ¿tances ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which might have held in reference to all other creatures, yet not any that would hold in reference to ChriÅ¿t, whom he makes but a creature; therefore he is Å¿ilent. And though he gives inÅ¿tances of acts materially the Å¿ame, which are performed to God and men; as praying, obeying; and Å¿aith the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is in the manner of performing theÅ¿e acts, yet he gives no Å¿atisfaction in reference to this diverÅ¿ity of manner. And he mentions not the grounds of worÅ¿hip, and honour, and Å¿ervice, wherein the root of the difference lies; for, the grounds are Å¿uch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which we worÅ¿hip God, that becauÅ¿e we meet not with them in any creature we have to do with, therefore we neither dare give the Å¿ame worÅ¿hip for matter, or manner, that we give to God, to any creature.</p>
               <p>But as if he had given light enough, he concludes,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:48559:92"/> that <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 10. muÅ¿t be underÅ¿tood according to that Å¿enÅ¿e. What Å¿enÅ¿e means he? He would have God to be the principal and ultimate object in all worÅ¿hip; and that is enough, according to him; and being obÅ¿erved, ChriÅ¿t might have worÅ¿hipped the the devil, for any other caveat that he enters againÅ¿t it.</p>
               <p>I do not wrong him one whit; for his words are, That the command which ChriÅ¿t mentions in repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Satan that tempted him to worÅ¿hip him, <hi>Thou Å¿halt worÅ¿hip the Lord thy God, and him onely Å¿halt thou Å¿erve,</hi> muÅ¿t be reÅ¿trained to God, as he is the principal and ultimate object onely: and then if ChriÅ¿t had Å¿o underÅ¿tood it, as he doth, and reÅ¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to God his own place of worÅ¿hip, had made him his principal and ultimate object in worÅ¿hip, he might as the leÅ¿s principal and intermediate object, have worÅ¿hipped the devil, if he had pleaÅ¿ed. And this Text which he alledgeth, of <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. (if there had been none other) would not have been of any force in this Å¿ence againÅ¿t it. So that either ChriÅ¿t miÅ¿took the Scripture, and alledged a Text that had not Å¿trength againÅ¿t worÅ¿hipping of Satan, or elÅ¿e he hath groÅ¿ly miÅ¿taken the Å¿enÅ¿e of the Scripture which ChriÅ¿t hath alleadged, in giving liberty for intermediate worÅ¿hip to be given to him that is not God, notwithÅ¿tanding any thing contained in this Text.</p>
               <p>But becauÅ¿e he keeps to generals, and by that means reÅ¿olves no Å¿cruple that may lie in the breaÅ¿ts
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:48559:93"/> of men about worÅ¿hip. I Å¿hall deÅ¿cend to Å¿ome particulars.</p>
               <p>And firÅ¿t, I Å¿hall Å¿peak of worÅ¿hip proper to God in the matter of it, wherein he is wholly Å¿ilent; and then of worÅ¿hip proper in the manner of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.</p>

               </p>
               <p>And the obeying of the will of another, for this Å¿ole reaÅ¿on, becauÅ¿e it is the will of that other, when there is no other impulÅ¿ive cauÅ¿e but that, is honour peculiar and proper to God alone, becauÅ¿e his will, and his alone, is EÅ¿Å¿entially holy and juÅ¿t, and good. <hi>I conÅ¿ulted not with fleÅ¿h and blood</hi> (Å¿aith <hi>Paul)</hi> when the will of God was revealed that he Å¿hould teach him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 15, 16. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 2.</p>

In external poÅ¿tures, in Religious duties, the proÅ¿tration of the body towards the earth, and kneeling upon the knees towards the ground, is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and honour, and worÅ¿hip peculiar to God: <hi>O come let us fall down and kneel before the Lord our Maker,</hi> Å¿aith the Prophet, in <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 95. 6. And its that which neither Angel nor men durÅ¿t aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ume, no nor admit of, but repelled it, and rejected it as undue, and directed it to God.</p>
               <p>Many more particulars there are, reÅ¿pecting the matter of worÅ¿hip, where God hath a peculiarity in point of right to worÅ¿hip and honour, above the creature: but Å¿ome light is let in to Å¿uch (which might be groping in the dark) by theÅ¿e.</p>
               <p>I Å¿hall take in that light which ChriÅ¿t affords, (while I Å¿peak of the manner of worÅ¿hip) and Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie my Å¿elf with that. He Å¿ums up all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments that reÅ¿pect God, in theÅ¿e words; <hi>Thou Å¿halt love the Lord thy God, and Å¿erve him with all thy Å¿oul, with all thy mind, with all thy Å¿trength and might.</hi> So that that which is peculiar in the manner of worÅ¿hip, is the meaÅ¿ure of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance Å¿uch a meaÅ¿ure ought not to be given to any creature as to God: a perÅ¿on may be eaÅ¿ily peccant in the exceÅ¿s in reference to the creature: if he give all to the creature, he gives too much; but leÅ¿s then all, is too little for God; the utmoÅ¿t created height is due to God, and peculiarly due to him, and to none other.</p>
               <p n="1">1. An abÅ¿olute Faith, and affiance, and truÅ¿t, is
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:48559:95"/> due to God alone, whatever the Subject-matter of it be, becauÅ¿e there is an abÅ¿olute and an indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Å¿ufficiency in God alone<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> to effect every thing; therefore it is that which the Lord pronounceth a bleÅ¿Å¿ed thing, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 7. <hi>BleÅ¿Å¿ed is the man that truÅ¿teth in the Lord, and whoÅ¿e hope the Lord is:</hi> And the contrary the Lord pronounceth a curÅ¿ed thing, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>CurÅ¿ed be he that truÅ¿teth in man, and maketh fleÅ¿h his arm.</hi> A like place we have in <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 146. 3, 5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An abÅ¿olute and unbounded love is due to God alone, becauÅ¿e he is infinite in goodneÅ¿s; and not to be given to any creature, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 15. <hi>Love not the world, nor the things of the world,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>Much more might be added, if need did require: At preÅ¿ent, let it Å¿atisfie the Reader, that I have thus far opened the difference in the matter and in the manner, betwixt the worÅ¿hip due to God, and that which may be given to the creature, which he left olded up in his DiÅ¿courÅ¿e about it. I muÅ¿t now
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:48559:96"/> proceed to follow him in his AnÅ¿wer.</p>
               <p>He concludes his AnÅ¿wer to the Maior, with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration: his words are;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I wonder at the adjection</hi> (Meer) <hi>which you add to creature, as if a creature in eÅ¿Å¿ence could be more then a meer creature; or, as if Å¿ome creature might have, as its right and due, that honour, worÅ¿hip, and Å¿ervice which the Scripture doth appropriate to the moÅ¿t High God.</hi> And then he determines, <hi>Sure I am</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>creatures, as creatures, are excluded from Å¿haring with God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> I wonder that he Å¿hould make a wonder of that which himÅ¿elf is able to reÅ¿olve, according to the common Tenent which himÅ¿elf Å¿o lately held; and if he cannot, a child well bred, of 8 or 10 years old, can render a reaÅ¿on for it. ChriÅ¿t is a creature, and<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> yet not a meer creature: according to the fleÅ¿h, or as he is the Å¿on of <hi>Abraham,</hi> he is a creature; but according to the Spirit of HolineÅ¿s, or as he is the Son of God, he is not a creature: ChriÅ¿t is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, God-man, or God manifeÅ¿ted in the fleÅ¿h; a creature, and yet created according to the divers natures that are in him. ConÅ¿ider him in one of his natures, as born of the Virgin, as the Å¿on of <hi>Mary,</hi> Å¿o he is a creature in eÅ¿Å¿ence, and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pect he is no more then a creature, and is excluded from Å¿haring with God in divine honour, worÅ¿hip, and Å¿ervice; but conÅ¿ider him in both his natures, conÅ¿ider the whole of him, and then he is not a meer creature, but he is more then a creature; he is Å¿uch
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:48559:96"/> a creature, as that he is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                  </gap>, the great Creator of all things, and Å¿o he Å¿hares with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in divine honour, but not as a creature, though he be a creature; for this perÅ¿on ChriÅ¿t, is both God and a Creature.</p>
               <p>After he had Å¿poken to the Major, he comes to conÅ¿ider of the Minor propoÅ¿ition, <hi>viz.</hi> That divine worÅ¿hip, and honour, and Å¿ervice, is by Scripture-warrant given to ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us.</p>
               <p>His AnÅ¿wer is, <hi>Sir, it is granted that JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t is the intermediate object of divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip, honour and Å¿ervice, being Gods Vice-Roy, and acting among them in his Fathers Name, which the Scripture you bring confirms; But where the Scripture allows worÅ¿hip, honour, and Å¿ervice to be given to him, as the principal and ultimate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject thereof, is not yet made to appear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. This diÅ¿tinction of intermediate object in reference to any meer creature, and principal and ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Object, is unÅ¿criptural, he cannot bottom it upon any Text in reference to divine and Religious preÅ¿cribed worÅ¿hip.</p>
               <p>2. It is repugnant to Scripture-TeÅ¿timony in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the whole of ChriÅ¿t whom the Father will have to be honoured, as himÅ¿elf is honoured, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 23. <hi>That all may honour the Son as they honour the Father:</hi> The Father will have no honour which the Son hath not; will have nothing in honour that is peculiar, that may be accounted proper to him:
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:48559:97"/> the Father will have no preeminence in worÅ¿hip above the Son; but look in what manner he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires men to honour him he requires them to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour his Son; and unleÅ¿s they do it, he accounts not himÅ¿elf honoured. If then the Father be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped as the principal &amp; ultimate object the Son muÅ¿t be worÅ¿hipped as the principal and ultimate object, elÅ¿e he is not honored as the Father is honored: The honouring of the Father is made the pattern and the example of honouring the Son. And if ChriÅ¿t Å¿hould be but a creature, if this be not Gods giving his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to another, when the like glory is given to him that is not God, as to him that is God; the like to the Son as, to the Father, and that according to the Fathers own deÅ¿igne and counÅ¿el; Let him that hath underÅ¿tanding judge: however, it overthrows his diÅ¿tinction.</p>
               <p>The place alÅ¿o that I alledged in <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 12, 13, 14. which he Å¿aith confirms his diÅ¿tinction, is fully againÅ¿t it; for all creatures in heaven, earth, under the earth, are repreÅ¿ented by <hi>John</hi> in the Å¿ervice of bleÅ¿Å¿ing, praiÅ¿ing, honouring, glorifying the Father and the Son, in like manner, without any diÅ¿tinction: they are not heard worÅ¿hipping the Father through the Son, but worÅ¿hipping and honouring both Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Son, in like manner as two equals, or as two coeÅ¿Å¿ential perÅ¿ons in the Godhead. Yea, leÅ¿t it Å¿hould be imagined, that he that Å¿itteth upon the Throne, is the principal object of the worÅ¿hip, and that the Lamb is the leÅ¿s principal, Å¿ubordinate, and
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:48559:97"/> intermediate object of it, becauÅ¿e he is mentioned firÅ¿t, and the Lamb is mentioned after him; therefore <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 14. the four and twenty Elders are brought in, in this viÅ¿ion, worÅ¿hipping him alone <hi>who liveth for ever and ever,</hi> without the mention of any other, though other perÅ¿ons are not excluded. And who is this perÅ¿on that liveth for ever and ever? It is ChriÅ¿t, who gives himÅ¿elf this Title, though it be his Fathers Title alÅ¿o, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>I am he that liveth and was dead, and behold I live for ever and ever:</hi> So it is in the Greek, and it concurs in words with this Text of <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 14.</p>
               <p>3. This diÅ¿tinction, as he brings it and means it, opens a door to the worÅ¿hipping of men or Angels, any that may be called God's repreÅ¿entatives, and which act among men in Gods Name: for if that be the formal reaÅ¿on of worÅ¿hip given to ChriÅ¿t, <hi>He is Gods Vice-Roy or RepreÅ¿entative</hi> (which are not Scriptural Titles, but names of his own or others deviÅ¿ing) <hi>and he is one that acts in Gods Name,</hi> then worÅ¿hip may be given to <hi>MoÅ¿es, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hua,</hi> the Prophets; for <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> was in Gods Å¿tead to <hi>Aaron</hi> and to the people: <hi>I have made thee a God to Aaron,</hi> Å¿airh the Lord to him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 16. And the Prophets came in Gods Name; may they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be worÅ¿hipped? According to his Argument they may; yea, any perÅ¿on or thing that is a means by whom or by which God diÅ¿penÅ¿eth himÅ¿elf to men, in a Religious or Å¿piritual way, or by whom or
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:48559:98"/> which we come to God in worÅ¿hip, may be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate object of Religious worÅ¿hip, and Å¿o we may worÅ¿hip our MiniÅ¿ters which go to God for us, and from God come to us; and we may worÅ¿hip the Scriptures and the Ordinances, by which we have communion with God; for theÅ¿e are intermediate things betwixt God and us in worÅ¿hip, may they therefore be intermediate objects of worÅ¿hip? Seeing he makes ChriÅ¿t Å¿uch a god as other creatures are, (but more eminent then they) Å¿uch a god as <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> was, as MagiÅ¿trates and Judges were which carried Gods authority in the Offices upon them, a god of the Å¿ame kinde with them; What reaÅ¿on can be rendered, if ChriÅ¿t be worÅ¿hipped upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, why they alÅ¿o (being Å¿uch-like gods as he, and coming with God's authority betwixt God and us) Å¿hould not be worÅ¿hipped as intermediate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, upon the Å¿ame account? But this is very groÅ¿s, and makes his aÅ¿Å¿ertion concerning worÅ¿hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping ChriÅ¿t as an intermediate object betwixt God and us, very groÅ¿s alÅ¿o.</p>
               <p>4. It is apparent that ChriÅ¿t both aÅ¿Å¿umed, and Saints and Angels have given to him, that very worÅ¿hip, and honour, and Å¿ervice which is peculiar to the high God alone, both for matter, and for manner.</p>

               <p>And if we have an eye to the manner of worÅ¿hip, we Å¿hall finde that ChriÅ¿t required it, and believers give it to him, in Å¿uch Å¿ort as the moÅ¿t high God can onely challenge it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. An abÅ¿olute and univerÅ¿al truÅ¿t and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is put in ChriÅ¿t, Å¿uch as, that he, who is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿ed to be the moÅ¿t high God, can challenge no more; and this both in the matters of the Å¿oul, in
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:48559:100"/> reference to which he is called <hi>the hope of IÅ¿rael, Act.</hi> 28. 20. and the perÅ¿on <hi>in whom the Gentiles truÅ¿t,</hi> Rom. 15. 12. and alÅ¿o in matters of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon providence, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>I truÅ¿t in the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us, to Å¿end Timotheus unto you Å¿hortly:</hi> that is, I truÅ¿t that ChriÅ¿t will Å¿o mercifully order it, that I Å¿hall Å¿end him, and that all impediments will be taken away. And if the providence of ChriÅ¿t doth extend to all things, and that the homage of depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance be given upon this account; what more can be Å¿aid of the moÅ¿t high God?</p>
               <p n="2">2. An abÅ¿olute and full love is both required and given to ChriÅ¿t; Å¿o that God, even the Father, can require no more: <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 37, <hi>He that loveth father, or mother, or Å¿on or daughter, more then me,</hi> (Å¿aith ChriÅ¿t) <hi>is not worthy of me.</hi> But <hi>Luke</hi> expreÅ¿Å¿eth it more fully, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 36. <hi>He that doth not hate father and mother, wife and children, brethren and Å¿iÅ¿ters,</hi> yea <hi>and his own life, for ChriÅ¿ts Å¿ake,</hi> from that dear reÅ¿pect he bears to ChriÅ¿t, <hi>is not worthy of him.</hi> And ChriÅ¿t would draw <hi>Peter</hi> up to a love above his neceÅ¿Å¿ary food: <hi>LoveÅ¿t thou me</hi> (Å¿aid ChriÅ¿t) <hi>more then theÅ¿e?</hi> The meat that was before him was meant, the fiÅ¿hes that they were to feed on. And the SpouÅ¿e was Å¿ick of love, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 8. And what greater proportion can the Father himÅ¿elf require, then what ChriÅ¿t asked, and what the Saints gave to him?</p>
               <p>The Inference then muÅ¿t needs be this: ChriÅ¿t is
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:48559:100"/> worÅ¿hipped, and honoured, and Å¿erved, with the worÅ¿hip, and honour, and Å¿ervice, not of an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate object, but of the Principal and Ultimate object: and all Å¿uch texts which give the Å¿ame wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip to the Son as to the Father, do prove it. And if it were not Å¿o, men had need to look to their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance and affection to ChriÅ¿t, leÅ¿t it Å¿hould exceed; and that they neither put their whole truÅ¿t in ChriÅ¿t, nor Å¿et their whole hearts upon him, which would be due to him alone who is the high God, and the principal and ultimate object of theÅ¿e motions of the Å¿oul. So that this Doctrine of his doth call off the Å¿oul from being too much Å¿et upon ChriÅ¿t, as if it were poÅ¿Å¿ible to minde him too much, and affect him too dearly: which Å¿hould make all the true lovers of ChriÅ¿t to abhor it the more.</p>
               <p>Object.</p>
               <p>There is one knot yet to be untied, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I paÅ¿s off from this point of WorÅ¿hip. It may be Å¿aid, ChriÅ¿t is to be worÅ¿hipped as Mediator: the Scripture is clear and manifeÅ¿t for it; <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 10, <hi>At the Name of JeÅ¿us every knee Å¿hall how:</hi> here is worÅ¿hip due to ChriÅ¿t, as exalted by the Father: Now he was exalted as he was Mediator, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to an Office that he had executed: and being Mediator, he is an intermediate object of worÅ¿hip: for a Mediator is one betwixt God and men, by which men come to God; and as Å¿uch an one, ChriÅ¿t is worÅ¿hipped.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> As ChriÅ¿t is Mediator, he hath a LordÅ¿hip
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:48559:101"/> given to him; in which reÅ¿pect he Å¿aid to be made Lord, as he is made Mediator; and Å¿o there is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip belonging to him: But it muÅ¿t be thus under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tood, That as his Official, Oeconomical, and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atorly LordÅ¿hip was founded in his Natural, EÅ¿Å¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial LordÅ¿hip, as he was the Son of God, and the moÅ¿t high God, coeÅ¿Å¿ential with the Father, as hath been proved before: Å¿o the WorÅ¿hip which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives as Mediator, as King, PrieÅ¿t, and Prophet of his Church, is founded not Å¿imply in or upon the Office, but upon the Excellencie of the perÅ¿on that manageth the Office; and if at all upon the Office, it is becauÅ¿e Å¿uch an Office cannot be executed but by Å¿uch a perÅ¿on who is the Son of God, and very God: For if it were poÅ¿Å¿ible to conceive how Å¿uch a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorly function could be performed by one that is not God, Divine religious worÅ¿hip would not be due unto him upon that account. It is the dignity of the PerÅ¿on that founds the WorÅ¿hip; and the Work doth but quicken to it; or becomes a motive the rather to perform Å¿uch homage and worÅ¿hip to him to whom it is due upon another account, upon another ground, if that Work had never been. WorÅ¿hip, and honour, and glory belonged to him, as the Å¿econd PerÅ¿on in the bleÅ¿Å¿ed Trinity, as the Eternal Son of God and God: and if over and above this glorious (and ever to be honoured and adored) perÅ¿on, become Mediator, it is the more readily and forwardly to be exhibited &amp; given. As every mercie
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:48559:101"/> received from the Father of mercie, becomes a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther engagement to worÅ¿hip and Å¿erve this Father of mercies; but the primitive ground is, This Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of mercies is God; otherwiÅ¿e, all mercie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conÅ¿ideration of the excellencie of the perÅ¿on from whom it proceeds, is not a right bottom to found worÅ¿hip upon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> was a Mediator betwixt God and men, and a Type of this our glorious Mediator, ChriÅ¿t: but <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> was but a Servant, not a Son; but a Creature, not God: and there was no religious worÅ¿hip nor honour that belonged to him, in reference to that work becauÅ¿e a meer creature performed it. And if it be otherwiÅ¿e in reference to ChriÅ¿t, that ChriÅ¿t as Mediator deÅ¿erves to be worÅ¿hipped; the reaÅ¿on is, becauÅ¿e Å¿uch a MediatorÅ¿hip as ChriÅ¿t perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, could not have been performed, unleÅ¿s ChriÅ¿t had been God; becauÅ¿e, to execute that Function, requires the infinite power and wiÅ¿dom of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head: And therefore <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> was the Type of that, which ChriÅ¿t really and effectually, and powerfully was: <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> was <hi>internuncius,</hi> one that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and the people; but ChriÅ¿t made the atonement and the peace, being greater then <hi>MoÅ¿es;</hi> he being onely typically God, but ChriÅ¿t really and truely God.</p>
               <p>And though ChriÅ¿t be intermediate, being Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, yet he would not could not thence become an intermediate object of WorÅ¿hip, unleÅ¿s becauÅ¿e the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:48559:102"/> Å¿ame perÅ¿on (though not according to both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) is alÅ¿o the principal and ultimate object of of it: which Å¿hews thus much, That this WorÅ¿hip which ChriÅ¿t the Mediator had, was due upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther account then his MediatorÅ¿hip; otherwiÅ¿e it would have been limited and reÅ¿trained, that that worÅ¿hip which is due to God, who is the ultimate object of worÅ¿hip, might have been diÅ¿cerned from it; and the preeminence the Father hath above ChriÅ¿t in WorÅ¿hip, would have been declared in Scripture.</p>
               <p>And hence it follows, that though ChriÅ¿t be an intermediate object of WorÅ¿hip, yet he is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal and ultimate object alÅ¿o: The Å¿ame perÅ¿on who is Man and Mediator, is the Son of God, &amp; the moÅ¿t high God, &amp; Mediator in that nature alÅ¿o: And if Religious Divine worÅ¿hip be given unto him as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, it is given unto him for the Å¿ake of the Divine Nature &amp; becauÅ¿e he is the Son of God, and God; according to which nature, apart conÅ¿idered from the Humane, he is the ultimate object of worÅ¿hip; but as conÅ¿idered with the Humane, as Mediator, he is the intermediate object of worÅ¿hip. And though the Humane Nature be taken up into the fellowÅ¿hip (as of the Godhead, Å¿o) of this honour and worÅ¿hip; yet this worÅ¿hip is not due, nor doth properly appertain to the Humane Nature: And though the perÅ¿on be honoured with this Divine honour, becauÅ¿e of the Union; yet it is for the Å¿ake of the Divine Nature, and not for the Å¿ake of the Humane, which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auÅ¿e
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:48559:102"/> it is not the principal and ultimate object of, worÅ¿hip; therefore that very worÅ¿hip, and no leÅ¿s, nor any other, is given to ChriÅ¿t, being thus interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate, or Mediator, which is proper and peculiar to God alone, who is the principal and ultimate object worÅ¿hip, cannot (Å¿eparately and apart conÅ¿idered from the Divine Nature) be any object at all, no not an intermediate object of Religious Divine worÅ¿hip: for then every creature that is a <hi>medium,</hi> or a means, by or through which God communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates himÅ¿elf to men, and Å¿o is intermediate betwixt God and man, Å¿hould be an intermediate object of Divine worÅ¿hip; which is directly repugnant to the Scripture, and is greatly derogatory to God. that the Manhood of ChriÅ¿t, or the Humane Nature, a part conÅ¿idered, hath but the reÅ¿pect of an inÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in Å¿o glorious a work, which was wrought by the efficiencie and infinite power &amp; wiÅ¿dom of God.</p>
               <p>I have been the larger in diÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿ing this point of WorÅ¿hip, becauÅ¿e the right underÅ¿tanding of it will facilitate the diÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿ing of the two next which follow, which reÅ¿pect Faith in ChriÅ¿t.

Though God, <hi>viz.</hi> the Father, and JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, be two objects of divine Faith, yet it is not true in the Å¿ence that he repreÅ¿ents it in, <hi>viz.</hi> that they are two objects really diÅ¿tinct from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for the Father that Å¿ent the Son JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, and the Son JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t that was Å¿ent, are not two diÅ¿tinct Gods, but one God; they are not two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tinct EÅ¿Å¿ences, though they be two diÅ¿tinct Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tÅ¿tences, or perÅ¿ons; Å¿o the object eÅ¿Å¿entially and really is but one: To this agrees the place which he quotes, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 44. <hi>He that beleeveth on me, beleeveth not on me, but on him that Å¿ent me.</hi> An ExpoÅ¿itor of note puts this Å¿ence upon it: <hi>Not on me,</hi> that is, Å¿uch whom you take me to be, a man, and no more; but <hi>on me</hi> the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal God, and then Å¿ame in EÅ¿Å¿ence with him that Å¿ent me. He puts another Å¿ence upon it, Å¿aying, <hi>He that beleeves one, beleeves both, becauÅ¿e God appears merciful in the face of ChriÅ¿t, and ChriÅ¿t appears inÅ¿trumental in the hand of God,</hi> Rom. 4. 24. and 10. 9. And Å¿o he makes ChriÅ¿t an inÅ¿trument (who could not (as he Å¿aith) raiÅ¿e himÅ¿elf from the dead) the object of faith, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our ReÅ¿urrection and Salvation, which is groÅ¿s; for ChriÅ¿t is the object of our faith, as he is able to Å¿ave, not himÅ¿elf onely, but us, to the utmoÅ¿t. And
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:48559:105"/> though ChriÅ¿t be the Son conÅ¿idered as Å¿ent, and as having taken fleÅ¿h, and as Mediator, and Å¿o is the object of faith; yet he is the Å¿ame perÅ¿on as before he took FleÅ¿h, and was Mediator, though under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conÅ¿ideration; yet the taking of FleÅ¿h hath not made him another perÅ¿on, much leÅ¿s another being; and Å¿till he remains the Å¿ame God with his Father.</p>
               <p>And though as he is conÅ¿idered in FleÅ¿h, and as Mediator, he be an intermediate object of faith, yet he is alÅ¿o the principal and ultimate object of faith, as he is the Eternal Son, and Å¿econd perÅ¿on in the Trinity; for the Å¿ame perÅ¿on may be both the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate and the ultimate object of Faith, under a divers conÅ¿ideration: this was one part of his emptying of himÅ¿elf; the Son became Mediator in FleÅ¿h, and Å¿o the intermediate object of faith, who yet was, with the Father, the ultimate Object of it.</p>
               <p>And ChriÅ¿t, though he had been Mediator, yet if he had not been God, he could not have been the intermediate Object of Faith, no more then <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> was, who was Mediator; he was not the Object of Faith, nor could be, becauÅ¿e he was but a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> was one by whom they beleeved on God, and Å¿o were the Prophets, and alÅ¿o the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tles: <hi>Paul</hi> Å¿aith of himÅ¿elf and of <hi>Apollo,</hi> that they were MiniÅ¿ters by whom the <hi>Corinthians</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Mediums</hi> or means by whom
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:48559:105"/> they were brought to faith in ChriÅ¿t and God; but Objects they were not, no not intermediate objects of their Faith; Å¿o ChriÅ¿t could have been but a means of faith in God, if he had been no more but a man, and had not been God.</p>
               <p>The brazen Serpent, which was a Type of ChriÅ¿t, to which the promiÅ¿e was made, That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever looked up to it, Å¿hould be healed, (and it was really Å¿o; they were healed, as God in the promiÅ¿e Å¿aid, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. 8, 9.) was onely a means by which they beleeved in God, being but a creature, and not an intermediate Object of Faith; they did not beleeve on it at all, but through it, on God; and Å¿o it muÅ¿t have been Å¿aid of ChriÅ¿t, had he been but a meer creature, had he been but onely the man JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t.</p>
               <p>And though it cannot be denyed, but that whole ChriÅ¿t, as conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of two natures, being God and man, is Mediator, and materially conÅ¿idered is the intermediate Object of Faith; yet not the whole of ChriÅ¿t is the formal cauÅ¿e of faith in ChriÅ¿t, but the Divinity or Godhead of ChriÅ¿t alone, is the formal cauÅ¿e, and reaÅ¿on, and ground of the faith of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tians in ChriÅ¿t; for that is the Rock upon which the Å¿ouls of Saints are built, and a firm, unÅ¿haken, unmoveable Rock it is, and the gates of hell Å¿hall never prevail againÅ¿t Beleevers, whoÅ¿e faith doth bottom them upon this Rock.</p>
               <p>But he Å¿aith, <hi>It is from Gods commandment,</hi>

                  <hi>Rep.</hi> All faith that juÅ¿tifies and Å¿aves, as well that which hath God, <hi>viz.</hi> the Father for its Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as that which hath ChriÅ¿t for its Object, is by Gods commandment and appointment juÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and Å¿aving: for the firÅ¿t Covenant was of Works; which men brake, and were under death by breaking it; and then came both the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of faith, and the promiÅ¿e of life, that was made to faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>The Scripture foreÅ¿ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that God would juÅ¿tifie the heathen through faith,</hi> &amp;c. God freely made choyce of faith, to Å¿ave men by it, as well of that which reÅ¿pects him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf, as that which reÅ¿pects ChriÅ¿t. I hope he will confeÅ¿s that it was by inÅ¿titution that faith in him that Å¿ent ChriÅ¿t, <hi>viz.</hi> the Father, is needful and is Å¿aving.</p>
               <p>But if his meaning be, that no faith was due to ChriÅ¿t naturally, Å¿ave what is due by vertue of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment and commandment; It is utterly untrue, if extendeded to whole ChriÅ¿t; for ChriÅ¿t is the natural EÅ¿Å¿ential Son of God; and look what faith was due to the Father, the Å¿ame faith is due to ChriÅ¿t, as the Eternall Co-effential Son of God.</p>
               <p>Or if this Å¿enÅ¿e be given to the words, that there was nothing but a Commandment, that could move
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:48559:106"/> or draw to faith in ChriÅ¿t, that is falÅ¿e alÅ¿o; for <hi>Nathanael</hi> was drawn to beleeve without any commandment, that came to him to that purpoÅ¿e, from thoÅ¿e beams of his Deity, which Å¿parkled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him in thoÅ¿e words of his. <hi>Before Philip cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thee, when thou waÅ¿t under the Fig-tree, I Å¿aw thee;</hi> And many others believed on him when they Å¿aw his Miracles; So that not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment onely, but his own AlmightineÅ¿s and Infinite Excellency, brought credit and gained faith to him.</p>
               <p>The concluÅ¿ion is this: Though it Å¿hould be granted, that Faith in the Father and faith in ChriÅ¿t do act in a divers manner (as indeed it muÅ¿t, ChriÅ¿t being conÅ¿idered as Mediator) yet it will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that either in one manner or another Faith doth act upon a creature, but that Å¿till the perÅ¿on is God that it acteth upon.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> To level one aÅ¿Å¿ertion againÅ¿t another, is to level Arguments by way of oppoÅ¿ition, not to
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:48559:107"/> anÅ¿wer Arguments by way of Å¿atisfaction: Yea, it is to evade anÅ¿wering by objecting. And it is a Å¿lie and crafty way of anÅ¿wering, when there is a knot which is difficult, and perhaps impoÅ¿Å¿ible to be untyed, in any Scripture or Argument, to paÅ¿s it over with Å¿ilence, and onely propoÅ¿e Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what which may trouble and perplex the truth in it, or the mind rather of him that reads it. Thus he did in his AnÅ¿wer to the two laÅ¿t InÅ¿tances, and now again he runs to theÅ¿e fig-leaves to cover the nakedneÅ¿s of his Tenent from that Å¿hame which this Argument or InÅ¿tance, enforced with Å¿o uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable a Scripture, would caÅ¿t upon it. But I Å¿hall inforce the Scripture alleadged by me, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it will carry conviction along with it to the hearts of Å¿uch who Å¿hall duely perpend and conÅ¿ider it; and afterwards Å¿hew the weakneÅ¿s of his aÅ¿Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>In this Scripture of <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 10, 11, 13. the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tle Å¿peaks of ChriÅ¿t all along: in <hi>v.</hi> 10. he calls the doctrine of the GoÅ¿pel, the Doctrine of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour God. So it is in the Original, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. <hi>That they may adorn the GoÅ¿pel of our Saviour God:</hi> in <hi>v.</hi> 11. he Å¿peaks of the Å¿ame God ChriÅ¿t: for by the grace of God, he means the GoÅ¿pel of grace, or the Doctrine of Grace, which he had in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer verÅ¿e called the Doctrine of our Saviour God. This Doctrine or GoÅ¿pel hath appeared unto all
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:48559:108"/> men: in <hi>ver.</hi> 13, he Å¿tiles ChriÅ¿t the bleÅ¿Å¿ed hope, which is elÅ¿ewhere made the title of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 13. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 21. And he puts the denomination of the great God and our Saviour upon ChriÅ¿t. It is not <hi>a great God,</hi> without an article, as he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged to evade the Å¿trength of <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 1. But it is <hi>the great God,</hi> with an Article. This Text I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ented among the Scriptures which I produced, and it was the third in order; but he paÅ¿Å¿ed over it then, promiÅ¿ing to Å¿peak to it when he Å¿hould give in his anÅ¿wer to another Paper; and here he takes no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it neither: What may be the reaÅ¿on? but becauÅ¿e he is not able to preÅ¿ent any thing which can clould and darken the bright evidence of it; for it witneÅ¿Å¿eth two things with great clearneÅ¿s, 1. That ChriÅ¿t is God, great God, the great God, or that one great God. 2. That ChriÅ¿t, though he be man as well as God, yet he is Saviour chiefly and eÅ¿pecially as he is God, and not as he is man; For, conÅ¿idered as God, he is able to Å¿ave to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moÅ¿t. As he is man, there are actions done by him, and Å¿ufferings born, by which men are Å¿aved; but the vertue, force, efficacie, and valour of both the one and other, are as he is God.</p>
               <p>And he Å¿aveth with the Father as the principal efficient, <hi>IÅ¿a.</hi> 45. 21. <hi>I am a juÅ¿t God and a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and there is none beÅ¿ide me.</hi> This is the perÅ¿on that took fleÅ¿h, that thus Å¿peaks. It is cleer from <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 10, 11, that it is ChriÅ¿t; but the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:48559:108"/> Father is not excluded; and the meaning is, there is none other God that Å¿aves, but what ChriÅ¿t is: BecauÅ¿e the Father, and ChriÅ¿t, and the Spirit, are one principal efficient that Å¿aves.</p>
               <p>It is further confirmed, <hi>HoÅ¿.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>I will Å¿ave them by Jehovah their God:</hi> it is the Å¿peech of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah the Father, concerning Jehovah the Son, whom he calls their God; and promiÅ¿eth them to Å¿ave by him. And it muÅ¿t not be underÅ¿tood that this Å¿alvation is inÅ¿trumentally effected, becauÅ¿e it is Å¿aid, <hi>I will Å¿ave them by,</hi> &amp;c. For, the titles given to the perÅ¿on by whom the Father will Å¿ave, do Å¿hew that he is not an inÅ¿trument. Is Jehovah their God but an inÅ¿trument in Å¿aving? Is one Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah inÅ¿trumental to another? or is it onely the order of working betwixt the Father and the Son? Are there two Jehovahs, and both of them our God? <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> tells IÅ¿rael, <hi>Jehovah our God is our Jehovah;</hi> for EÅ¿Å¿ence one, though two in perÅ¿ons, <hi>Deut.</hi> 60. 4. The order then betwixt the perÅ¿ons is onely to be obÅ¿erved and acknowledged, not any Å¿uperiority or inferiority in working.</p>
               <p>But let me conÅ¿ider his aÅ¿Å¿ertion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To affirm JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t to be the Saviour of men without God, or equal with God, is contrary to the current of Scripture.</hi> Thus he.</p>
               <p>But againÅ¿t what expreÅ¿Å¿ions of mine is this aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ertion
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:48559:109"/> levelled? I have affirmed that whoever Å¿aves, muÅ¿t be God; therefore ChriÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e he Å¿aves, muÅ¿t be God. But where have I Å¿aid that ChriÅ¿t Å¿aves without God? To Å¿ave as God, and to Å¿ave without God, are theÅ¿e two one thing? Or are they not rather repugnant and contrary to one another? But Å¿uppoÅ¿e (as it muÅ¿t needs be) that by God he means the Father, I have not aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erted that ChriÅ¿t Å¿aves without the Father, by way of efficiency, but the Father Å¿aves by the Son, ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us, and the Son Å¿aves from the Father: But I aÅ¿Å¿ert them to be equals in Å¿aving, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding this order betwixt them: for it is but one God that Å¿aves, though in diverÅ¿ity of perÅ¿ons; and this one God cannot be Å¿uperiour and inferiour to himÅ¿elf. And all the confirmation that he himÅ¿elf gives of his own PoÅ¿ition, is this, That God in Scripture is diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed from ChriÅ¿t, in the work of Salvation; and he quotes, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 1. where God is Å¿aid to be our Saviour, and the Lord JeÅ¿us is onely Å¿aid to be our hope: But this hath no Å¿trength in it; for in <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 4. God hath not the title of Saviour given unto him, when he is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ChriÅ¿t, but hath the relative title of Father onely given him; but ChriÅ¿t is called Saviour, and is diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed from God by that name. Is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, <hi>viz.</hi> the Father, leÅ¿s a Saviour, or an unequal Saviour to ChriÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e ChriÅ¿t, and not he<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> is called a Saviour? And is not ChriÅ¿t called
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:48559:109"/> both the bleÅ¿Å¿ed hope, and the great God our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our? Are not both titles put upon him, as due to him? And though they are uÅ¿ed by the ApoÅ¿tle to diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h the perÅ¿ons of Father and Son from each other when they are Å¿poken of together, yet both theÅ¿e are applyed to both perÅ¿ons, and are proper to him alone, that is the moÅ¿t high God.</p>
               <p>But he Å¿aith,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scripture doth prefer God in the work of Å¿al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation before our Lord JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, making him to be the principal Agent therein, when it declares that the work of ChriÅ¿t in Å¿aving, was from the purpoÅ¿e of God, who appointed him for it; from the precept of God, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned him to it; and from the preÅ¿ence of God, who aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿ted him in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> But where doth Scripture witneÅ¿s this of God the Father, in reference to the whole of ChriÅ¿t? He Å¿aith, Scripture doth abundantly Å¿et forth all theÅ¿e; but he doth not quote any one place for proof of them, but would have us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it upon his word. That God purpoÅ¿ed to Å¿ave by ChriÅ¿t, conÅ¿idered as <hi>David</hi>'s and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>'s Å¿on, conÅ¿idered according to his Manhood; that God enjoyned him as Å¿uch, that God aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿ted him as Å¿uch (God being taken eÅ¿Å¿entially and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, for Father, Son, and holy GhoÅ¿t; and not
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:48559:110"/> improperly and perÅ¿onally, for the Father) will be granted; and it will be plentifully made out by Scripture: but that the Father purpoÅ¿ed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Son and holy GhoÅ¿t, and commanded and enjoyned without the Son and holy GhoÅ¿t, and aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿ted without the Son and holy GhoÅ¿t; this is denied. For as the Father without the Son and holy GhoÅ¿t made not man, but the Trinity Å¿ate in Councel; <hi>Let us make man:</hi> Å¿o it was in the work of Salvation; it was an act of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel: The Father gave the Son, and the Son gave himÅ¿elf, emptied himÅ¿elf: every PerÅ¿on concurred and wrought in the work, Å¿o far as concerns effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie: All decreed it, all acted in it, as one principal Agent; and onely the Humanity of ChriÅ¿t was InÅ¿trumental.</p>
               <p>And if we conÅ¿ider the Material and Merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cauÅ¿e of mens Å¿alvation, God the Father, or God in the perÅ¿on of the Father, is far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Principal cauÅ¿e thereof; for he is no cauÅ¿e at all: for the Father took not fleÅ¿h upon him, nor was Mediator either of Satisfaction or Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ion; he made not the Atonement; but this was the Son's Å¿ole work, he did all in it; he was the perÅ¿on that was <hi>made of a Virgin,</hi> and was <hi>made under the Law;</hi> he was the perÅ¿on that <hi>was made fleÅ¿h,</hi> and <hi>manifeÅ¿ted in fleÅ¿h;</hi> and hath a peculiar right, in this reÅ¿pect, to the denomination of <hi>Saviour.</hi> And though all was
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:48559:110"/> acted and endured in and by the fleÅ¿h that he aÅ¿Å¿umed: for he bare our Å¿ins on his body on the tree; yea, and in his Å¿oul alÅ¿o, when he cried out, <hi>My God, my God,</hi> &amp;c. in Å¿uch manner; yet if that fleÅ¿h had not been Å¿upported by the Godhead of the Son, which aÅ¿Å¿umed it, it would have been crumbled to duÅ¿t and powder by that weight of wrath that lay upon it: So that it was by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and power of the Godhead, that Å¿uch actings and Å¿uch Å¿ufferings were; and all was accounted as done and Å¿uffered by the Son, though the Son, as the Son, was not capable of it, but by aÅ¿Å¿uming fleÅ¿h into the unity of his perÅ¿on; and Å¿o it came to be reckoned as his work; and it was in account as if <hi>the Lord of glory</hi> had been crucified, and as if <hi>the blood of God</hi> had been Å¿pilt, and the merit was from the excellencie of the perÅ¿on of the Son, that did and Å¿uffered all.</p>

               <p>Secondly, A peremptory ConcluÅ¿ion, that <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 4, 5, 6. puts it out of queÅ¿tion.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A defective and inÅ¿ufficient probation, or confirmation; he alledgeth the words of the Text as if they did carry with them conviction of what he aÅ¿Å¿erts in the very letter of them, when as there is no Å¿uch matter.</p>
               <p>1. Scripture is Å¿o far from revealing Å¿uch a thing of ChriÅ¿ts inÅ¿trumentalneÅ¿s, that it reveals the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it: in <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. it is Å¿aid, <hi>That ChriÅ¿t by himÅ¿elf purged away our Å¿ins;</hi> but of any inÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments can it be Å¿aid that by himÅ¿elf he doth any thing? Doth an inÅ¿trument act by himÅ¿elf, that is, by his own vertue and Å¿ufficiency? and by himÅ¿elf, that is, without the power of the principal efficient? Is an InÅ¿trument any thing out of the hand of the chief Agent? AlÅ¿o in <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. it is Å¿aid, <hi>That ChriÅ¿t is able to Å¿ave to the utmoÅ¿t;</hi> But is any InÅ¿trument able to Å¿ave to the utmoÅ¿t? Hath he the ability within himÅ¿elf? So that it may be Å¿aid of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:48559:111"/> him, that he is able? What greater thing can be predicated of the principal efficient, or chief A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, then that he is able to Å¿ave to the utmoÅ¿t? This is too high an expreÅ¿Å¿ion for an InÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And in <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 89. 19, it is Å¿aid of ChriÅ¿t (whom <hi>David</hi> typified) that God had <hi>laid help upon one that was mighty.</hi> If ChriÅ¿t be onely but an InÅ¿trument, what needs he to be mighty in himÅ¿elf? for every InÅ¿trument if it be mighty through the might of another (as the <hi>Rams horns</hi> were) it is Å¿ufficient. What need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the choice of a mighty one, if the Saviour be onely inÅ¿trumental? The weaker the InÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the more honour will the Principal Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient have. The excellencie of Power is known to be of God, when the inÅ¿trumental means is WeakneÅ¿s and FooliÅ¿hneÅ¿s. Why alÅ¿o could not the blood of Goats have cleanÅ¿ed the ConÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but the Blood of JESUS CHRIST, God's Son, was neceÅ¿Å¿ary, if an InÅ¿trument may be a Saviour? DoubtleÅ¿s, a word of InÅ¿titution would have made the one as effectual as the other.</p>
               <p>But indeed, there is no might that any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-InÅ¿trument is capable to be recipient or the Å¿ubject of, that can Å¿ave to the utmoÅ¿t, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e it requires an infinite power to conquer Sin and Satan, Death and Hell; to aboliÅ¿h theÅ¿e, and to bring Life and Immortality to light;
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:48559:112"/> to effect a firÅ¿t and Å¿econd ReÅ¿urrection for men who were to be Å¿aved.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Scripture that he alleadgeth out of <hi>Titus</hi> 3. 3, 4, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>, hath no Å¿uch thing engraven upon it, as he produceth it for; Å¿uch that <hi>he that runs may read</hi> it written there, or he that reads may underÅ¿tand without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tioning, that whole ChriÅ¿t is but an InÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>For all that is aÅ¿Å¿erted by the ApoÅ¿tle, is, that God the Father our Saviour, Å¿aved through ChriÅ¿t our Saviour, by the holy GhoÅ¿t. And what doth this hold out, but the Order among the PerÅ¿ons in their working? And when JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOVAH Å¿aves by JEHOVAH their God, doth this particle <hi>[by]</hi> import inÅ¿trumentalneÅ¿s? I have Å¿hewed the contrary.</p>
               <p>Indeed, the Manhood of ChriÅ¿t is made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trumental to the Godhead of ChriÅ¿t, and to the whole Trinity, in this great deÅ¿igne of the Father, Son, and holy GhoÅ¿t, to Å¿ave men; but it cannot in this place be applied to the Manhood, becauÅ¿e the Spirit is Å¿hed or given from the Father, through ChriÅ¿t, not as Man, but as God, as I have Å¿hewed in the other TreatiÅ¿e.</p>

                  <hi>InÅ¿tance</hi> 5. The 5. InÅ¿tance he forms up into an Argument, thus, <hi>That Doctrine which makes the Mediator betwixt God and man, to be a meer crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, brings in (as it were) another GoÅ¿pel, deÅ¿troyes the true GoÅ¿pel in many of the parts of it,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in that it is againÅ¿t reaÅ¿on, that the Mediator Å¿hould be a creature, becauÅ¿e a meer creature is no way meet to be a DayÅ¿man for God<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> &amp; becauÅ¿e a Mediator muÅ¿t either partake of both God and man, or of neither, elÅ¿e he will be rather a party, then a Mediator,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and in that it oppoÅ¿eth theÅ¿e Scriptures,</hi> Mat. 1. 23. 1.

               <p>
                  <hi>This reaÅ¿on wants a reaÅ¿on to Å¿upport it, what Å¿hould hinder (Å¿aith he) but the meere creature may be a DayÅ¿man or Mediator?

               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> There are many things that may hinder, that a meere creature cannot be a DayÅ¿man, or Mediator for God: 1. The diÅ¿proportion that is betwixt God and a meere creature hinders, which diÅ¿proportion is infinite. It is againÅ¿t Gods honor and glory, that God Å¿hould admit of a meer ceature-DayÅ¿man or Mediator: It is as if a worm Å¿hould be a DayÅ¿man or Mediator for a man; or as if a begger Å¿hould be a DayÅ¿man or Mediator for a King. Nay there is not any thing to reÅ¿emble it by among all the creatures; and there would be too much honour put upon a meer creature, if he Å¿hould be Mediator or DayÅ¿man, becauÅ¿e a meer creature is infinitely below God; but a DayÅ¿man Å¿hould hold Å¿ome kind of equality with the perÅ¿on for whom he is a DayÅ¿man: For 1. The matter is committed to him that is a DayÅ¿man or Mediator. 2. The perÅ¿on that commits the matter to the DayÅ¿man, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits himÅ¿elf with it to him alÅ¿o. 3. A DayÅ¿man is one that muÅ¿t judge betwixt: now this is too low for God to admit of, and too high for man, or for any meer creature, that it Å¿hould be Å¿et <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>n Å¿uch a place. 2. The impotency and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iy of the creature hinders that it cannot be a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>meet DayÅ¿man for God: For 1. No meer creature can attain unto a perfect knowledge of the treÅ¿paÅ¿Å¿e and offence that is committed
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:48559:113"/> againÅ¿t God, becauÅ¿e it is infinite, therefore no finite creature can Å¿earch into it, the perÅ¿on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t whom it is committed being infinite, makes it infinite; and one of a finite knowledge cannot reach it: it may be truly Å¿aid, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man nor Angel, nor the Son of man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf, as man, knowes the greatneÅ¿Å¿e of mans Å¿in: for unleÅ¿Å¿e the greatneÅ¿Å¿e of God can be meaÅ¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, againÅ¿t whom it was committed, the greatneÅ¿Å¿e of the Å¿in cannot be known. Now if it cannot be known by any meer creature, then no meere creature can be a DayÅ¿man<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> to conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of it. 2. No meer creature can be Å¿uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently Å¿enÅ¿ible of the great diÅ¿honour that was offered unto God, and the great indignity and injury that was done againÅ¿t God, when man Å¿inned again him; for what is all creature-Å¿enÅ¿e, to that infinite perception which God hath of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>ffront done unto him; and unleÅ¿Å¿e you could make the creature as God, a creature cannot have the feeling of God; and unleÅ¿Å¿e a creature had the infinite holineÅ¿Å¿e of God, a creature cannot know how diÅ¿taÅ¿tfull Å¿in is unto God; therefore a meer creature cannot be a Mediator or DayÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man for God; for he cannot Å¿enÅ¿ibly enough conÅ¿ider of the tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ion againÅ¿t God. 3. No meer creature can make PropoÅ¿alls that are proportionable, in reference to Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that was impaired by the Å¿in of man, that God might be no loÅ¿er, nor might receive any
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:48559:114"/> detriment by Mediation; becauÅ¿e no creature knowes how much the honor of God is impair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and if he did, yet it would be beyond his power to offer honorable terms to God in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence thereto, for a creature will act and move like a creature, and all its PropoÅ¿alls will be low and little, and defective and Å¿hort, yea infinitely low &amp; Å¿hort, and like it Å¿elf, therfore a meer crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot be a meet DayÅ¿man for God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e he will be Å¿ure to wrong him. 4. The Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator betwixt God and man, is not of interceÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on onely, but of Å¿atisfaction; now no meer creature can give Å¿atisfaction for mens offences, becauÅ¿e offences are greater then can be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of, &amp; the Å¿atisfaction muÅ¿t be like them, that is, muÅ¿t be greater then can be imagined by any creature, therefore greater then can be given by any creature. The Mediator is an undertaker to Å¿atisfie for what is paÅ¿t by paying the utmoÅ¿t far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and to render man a new creature, incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and devoted to God, who was before an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie. Now no meer creature can be Å¿uch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaker, becauÅ¿e he cannot give a price Å¿ufficient nor work any Å¿uch transformation in man, but it belongs to him who made heaven and earth to do this.</p>
               <p>TheÅ¿e things are impediments why a meer creature cannot be a DayÅ¿man betwixt God and men, there are things to be known and done which creatures, as creatures, are not capable of.
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:48559:114"/> His daring therefore to aÅ¿Å¿ert the contrary, Å¿hews rather his preÅ¿umption then his wiÅ¿dome or ability.</p>
               <p>And whereas he Å¿aith, <hi>that he is able to prove that Christ of himÅ¿elf was not able to perform any work belonging to his MediatorÅ¿hip<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> unleÅ¿Å¿e by the aÅ¿Å¿istance of another, which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, and Å¿o was a compleat Mediator.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is utterly untrue and repugnant to the Scripture, for by himÅ¿elf he purged away our Å¿ins, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. and herein he debaÅ¿eth ChriÅ¿t not a little, he makes him as weak as one of us, and he concurres with thoÅ¿e enemies of ChriÅ¿t in their reproaches which they caÅ¿t upon him when he was upon the CroÅ¿Å¿e, he brings in the Å¿ame verdict with them, yea, he hath meaner thoughts in Å¿ome kind, then they, <hi>he Å¿aved others</hi> (Å¿aid they) <hi>but himÅ¿elf he cannot Å¿ave,</hi> that is, by his own power, he cannot, for otherwiÅ¿e they knew God could Å¿ave him; the ApoÅ¿tle had not Å¿o high thoughts of him, but he hath as low thoughts, I am able, Å¿aid the ApoÅ¿tle, to do all things through ChriÅ¿t Å¿trengthening me, but he faith, ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elf is able to do nothing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Fathers Å¿trengthening of him. If this be true which he aÅ¿Å¿erts, that ChriÅ¿t is able to pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form norhing of himÅ¿elf without aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance of another: God might then have Å¿aved by <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>James</hi> or <hi>John,</hi> or any man elÅ¿e, whom
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:48559:115"/> he would have looked upon in reference to that work, as by ChriÅ¿t. Is Å¿uch a Mediator as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciphers ChriÅ¿t to be (Å¿o poore, Å¿o empty as he makes him to be, not able to do any thing in diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of that office he is deÅ¿igned to of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf without aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance) a meet object of the faith, and hope of the Saints?</p>
               <p>If he had aÅ¿Å¿erted this of the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ChriÅ¿t, that it was able to do nothing by way of Å¿atisfaction in the function of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorÅ¿hip of it Å¿elf, without the aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance of the Divinity, or Godhead of ChriÅ¿t, it had been an undeniable truth, but to aÅ¿Å¿ert this of whole ChriÅ¿t, in whom the Å¿ullneÅ¿Å¿e of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head dwelt bodily, or Å¿ubÅ¿tantially, and eÅ¿Å¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, and in whom are hid all the treaÅ¿ures, all the mines of wiÅ¿dome<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> and knowledge, and all excellency, and in whom are all unÅ¿earchable riches, this is Å¿uch a vilifying of him, that it is a Å¿econd crucifying of him, and it is not his boaÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of being able to prove it that makes the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill the leÅ¿Å¿e, but it is the more horrid by how much he is confident, This Doctrine muÅ¿t needs weaken faith, &amp; hope, and affiance in ChriÅ¿t, and indeed if it were Å¿o (as he Å¿aith) that we had Å¿uch a Mediator, Å¿o impotent and Å¿o weak, of all creatures we were moÅ¿t miÅ¿erable.</p>
               <p>But he proceeds, and attempts to break the Å¿trength of the Å¿econd reaÅ¿on which I produced to prove, that a meer creature-ChriÅ¿t could not
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:48559:115"/> be Mediator betwixt God and men, which was this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>BecauÅ¿e a Mediator muÅ¿t either partake of both God and man, or of neither, elÅ¿e he will rather be a party then a Mediator.</hi>

                  <hi>Was not MoÅ¿es a Mediator betwixt God and men, but was MoÅ¿es God and man?</hi> Gal. 3. 19.</p>

                  <hi>Rep.

God reputatively he was, and repreÅ¿entatively; and this was Å¿uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for him that was not that true Mediator, but the Å¿hadow of him: but he that was Å¿hadowed out, and is no Å¿hadow, but Mediator indeed and in truth, he muÅ¿t be God indeed, and in truth: And this Argument of his fetched from <hi>MoÅ¿es,</hi> is Å¿trong againÅ¿t him, it is like that of <hi>MelchiÅ¿edech,</hi> produced to prove the eternity of ChriÅ¿t, upon which I have inÅ¿iÅ¿ted more largely, the Å¿inews of which no humane Å¿trength can cut aÅ¿under.</p>
               <p>But he Å¿aith, <hi>When I brought this reaÅ¿on, I knew not what I did, for it gives witneÅ¿Å¿e againÅ¿t me.</hi> And he argues againÅ¿t me by the help of the reaÅ¿on which I have produced. I Å¿aid, <hi>if Christ were not God as well as man, he would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <hi>If ChriÅ¿t the Mediator were God he was a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but ChriÅ¿t the Mediator was not a party, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ChriÅ¿t the Mediator was not God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> The Major PropoÅ¿ition how clear Å¿oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it is to him, is notÅ¿tithÅ¿tanding, unÅ¿ound, and untrue in it Å¿elf, for there is a twofold Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, there is <hi>Mediator participationis,</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator negationis;</hi> a Mediator of participation, and a Mediator of negation, that is, a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, that partakes of both, and a Mediator that partakes of neither. If there be a breach betwixt the father and the mother, and a child comes betwixt and mediates, the child Å¿tands re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated alike to both of them, and partakes equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of both of them, and is a Mediator of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation: If there be a breach betwixt two neighbours, and a third neighbour comes in and Mediates, he Å¿tands in relation to neither of them, nor partakes of either of them, he is a Mediator of negation, neither the one nor the other is any thing to him; neither of theÅ¿e Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators are parties: the latter is not by his own confeÅ¿Å¿ion, and it is as clear that the former is not, for he is not properly a party that partakes of both, but he that partakes not of both, or at leaÅ¿t, not of both alike, but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of the one, and not of the other, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes more of the one, then of the other; for
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:48559:116"/> diÅ¿parity of relation in the Mediator to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons betwixt whom he mediates, makes the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator a party, and not parity and equality. If there Å¿hould be a difference betwixt two bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and a third brother come in betwixt them to mediate and make peace, he is not a party, or if he be, he is a party to both, and a party to both, is in proper manner of Å¿peaking a party to neither; but if there be a controverÅ¿ie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two half brothers, and another comes in to mediate who is a whole brother to one of them, he is rather a party then a Mediator, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e he Å¿tands not in Å¿o near a relation to the one, as to the other.</p>
               <p>The application is eaÅ¿ie, ChriÅ¿t is a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor betwixt God and man, not of negation but of participation, for a man he is (without all controverÅ¿ie betwixt him and me) and in all things like to us, Å¿inne onely excepted, and if he be a man, then he partakes of man; and partaking of man, he calls men his brethren, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 11, and if he Å¿hould not partake of God equally, as he doth of man, and Å¿tand in like relation to God, as he doth to man, he would be a party rather than a Mediator, but being God as well as man, he is no party, but a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, or a middle perÅ¿on in a proper accepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not negatively, but relatively, Å¿tanding in equality of relation without any diÅ¿parity; and in this Å¿enÅ¿e, it would be true, (as he Å¿aith) that
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:48559:117"/> if ChriÅ¿t were God, he would be a party, if he were not man alÅ¿o as well as God, for then then there would be a diÅ¿parity, and inequality of relation in ChriÅ¿t the Mediator, in reference to the one of the perÅ¿ons betwixt whom he me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diates; he would be more nearly allyed to the one, then to the other, more to God then to man: but as he frames the Argument, if ChriÅ¿t the Mediator be God, then he is a party, when as it is manifeÅ¿t that he is man alÅ¿o, &amp; no nearer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to God, though he be God, then he is to man becauÅ¿e he is man: the Major is palpably falÅ¿e, &amp; muÅ¿t be denied: by that time he hath Å¿eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouÅ¿ly conÅ¿idered of this, which I have here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ented, I hope he will be forced to confeÅ¿Å¿e, that I knew<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> what I did when I brought that reaÅ¿on, that ChriÅ¿t, if a meer creature, would be a party rather then a Mediator. But he gives an inÅ¿tance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In reconciliation</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>by a Mediator, we are to Å¿uppoÅ¿e three: One offended, another offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a third mediating for peace betwixt them. God was offended, men were offenders, and ChriÅ¿t was the Mediator. Now if ChriÅ¿t had been a Å¿in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man, he had been of the party offending; and and if he had been God, he was the party offended; but Christ was not a Party: From the PropoÅ¿ition which I have thus confirmed, and the AÅ¿Å¿umption which you have acknowledged, I will draw up this ConcluÅ¿ion, That ChriÅ¿t the Mediator is not God.</hi>

                  <hi>Rep.</hi> In this InÅ¿tance, and in the application

That there be three in reconciliation wil be granted, but that the third muÅ¿t be Å¿o diÅ¿tinct as he holds it forth, as not to partake of the other two, is denied: For, a Å¿on that mediates betwixt father and mother (which may Å¿omtimes be the caÅ¿e) is of the fleÅ¿h of both, and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding is diÅ¿tinct from both but not Å¿o diÅ¿tinct as not to partake of both. So in the reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made by ChriÅ¿t betwixt God and man, there are three that are diÅ¿tinct: 1. There is God offended: 2. There is man, <hi>viz.</hi> mankind, offending: 3. There is ChriÅ¿t mediating, who is neither meerly and only God, nor yet meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and only man; but is both God and man, yet diÅ¿tinct from both God and man: DiÅ¿tinct from God becauÅ¿e he is man, and diÅ¿tinct from man, becauÅ¿e he is God. Yea there is yet a further di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tinction; for, ChriÅ¿t though he be man, <hi>viz.</hi> of that kind, for nature and eÅ¿Å¿ence, which was the offending party, yet not one of thoÅ¿e perÅ¿ons in that kind, that did offend, but without Å¿in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf; and though he be God, and Å¿o for eÅ¿Å¿ence and nature one with that party which was offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and was offended in his own perÅ¿on, yet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tinct in perÅ¿onality, or (which is all one) a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tinct perÅ¿on from the Father and the Holy GhoÅ¿t, who more viÅ¿ibly do manage the offence againÅ¿t man. For the Son, though he was offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:48559:118"/> together with the Father, and the Holy GhoÅ¿t, yet he appears not proÅ¿ecuting the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, but therein he is veiled, and appears only appeaÅ¿ing the Father that was offended: in both theÅ¿e reÅ¿pects there are three in this buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e of reconliation.</p>
               <p>But he makes mention of three in reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which in titles and names are the Å¿ame with the three which I have already Å¿poken of; <hi>viz.</hi> God, men, &amp; ChriÅ¿t: But when he comes to open and unfold theÅ¿e three, he makes the third, which mediates betwixt the other two, to be Å¿o di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tinct from both of them, as to partake of nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them: And under this lies couched the poyÅ¿on and malignancy of his doctrine; For, as he layes it down, he not only denies the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of ChriÅ¿t (which is the doctrine in diÅ¿pute betwixt us) but he deÅ¿troyes the Manhood alÅ¿o, and overturnes that Å¿atisfaction, which in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man he gave for man; for his words are theÅ¿e, <hi>If ChriÅ¿t had been a Å¿infull man, he had been of the party offending:</hi> His deÅ¿igne is to Å¿hew, that he was a diÅ¿tinct perÅ¿on, &amp; partaked of neither Party betwixt whom he mediated; <hi>He was not of the Party offending, for he was not a Å¿infull man; He was not the Party offended for he could not be God, becauÅ¿e he could not be a Party:</hi> Let it be conÅ¿idered Å¿eriouÅ¿ly what he Å¿aith, and it will be found to be falÅ¿e and dangerous, and reacheth not his own deÅ¿igne.</p>

                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:48559:118"/> 1. FalÅ¿e, for was ChriÅ¿t therefore not of that Party, becauÅ¿e he was without Å¿in? Was he not a true man in all things like other men, Å¿in onely excepted? Had he not a true Body and Soule? Was not Å¿oule and body Å¿ubject to the Å¿ame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities and weakneÅ¿Å¿es (Å¿in excepted) as other mens Å¿oules and bodies were? Was he not the Seed of the Woman which was promiÅ¿ed? Was he not conceived in the womb of the Virgin, and was fleÅ¿h of her fleÅ¿h? Was he not <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> Å¿eed, and <hi>Davids</hi> Å¿eed? Was not Satan to be broken and deÅ¿troyed in all his Å¿trength by one that muÅ¿t be of the Woman, that muÅ¿t Å¿pring out of her, and be her Å¿eed? And Å¿hould all this be, and yet ChriÅ¿t not this Party? He was no offender indeed, but yet he was of that Party which did offend, he had the Å¿ame nature for eÅ¿Å¿ence: <hi>Abraham</hi> was of that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which offended, and Å¿o was <hi>David,</hi> and were offenders themÅ¿elves, and he was their Å¿eed, and was of them and from them; therefore it is a great untruth and groÅ¿Å¿e miÅ¿take to Å¿ay that he was not of that Party; for he was fleÅ¿h of their fleÅ¿h, and bone of their bone, but kept by the Holy GhoÅ¿t from that naturall pollution and Å¿taine which defiled them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Dangerous; for if ChriÅ¿t were not of that party that offended, he could not Å¿atisfie for that party which offended; for in the Å¿ame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in which the offence was committed, muÅ¿t

It reacheth not his own deÅ¿igne, which is to make ChriÅ¿t a third and diÅ¿tinct perÅ¿on or party, from thoÅ¿e he mediates betwixt, parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of neither; for he knowes, that if it be confeÅ¿Å¿ed, that ChriÅ¿t partakes of the nature of one of the parties whom he is to make peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt, and not of the other, then he will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably be a party inÅ¿tead of a Mediator: to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void therefore this, he holds that he partakes of neither; and yet he makes ChriÅ¿t a man not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withÅ¿tanding, but not a man of the offending

But this diÅ¿tinction will not help him, for if he be a man, for Å¿ubÅ¿tance and eÅ¿Å¿ence like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>them, he is nearer related to them as Å¿uch, then he is to God, if he be not God; and then he will be a party Å¿till, rather then a Mediator.

That theÅ¿e two names do Å¿o neceÅ¿Å¿arily imply one the other, that they cannot be Å¿eparated, therefore the Prophet (Å¿peaking of his birth) Å¿aith, <hi>his name Å¿hall be called Immanuel,</hi> and the Angel, Å¿peaking of his birth, Å¿aith, <hi>his name Å¿hall be called JeÅ¿us,</hi> alluding therein to the Prophet, becauÅ¿e ChriÅ¿t is firÅ¿t <hi>Immanuel,</hi> and afterward <hi>JeÅ¿us,</hi> and he was <hi>Immanuel,</hi> that he might be <hi>JeÅ¿us,</hi> and he could not be <hi>JeÅ¿us,</hi> unleÅ¿Å¿e he were <hi>Immanuel;</hi> this is the cauÅ¿e, and that is the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and he that denies him to be <hi>Immanuel,</hi> denies him to be <hi>JeÅ¿us:</hi> therefore the Angel Å¿tiles him by the name, that is, the effect, and then Å¿ends us to conÅ¿ider of the name, which is the cauÅ¿e, which the Prophet gives him.</p>

                  <hi>Rep.</hi> It is true (as the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿aith) that a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator is not of one, that is, not of one Party, for
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:48559:123"/> a Mediators work is to make peace; now it is to be alwaies Å¿uppoÅ¿ed, that no one is at variance with himÅ¿elf, therefore a Mediator is not of one, but of two Parties that diÅ¿Å¿ent the one from the other, which Parties are God and Man.</p>
               <p>But his deduction which he fetcheth from this Å¿aying is faulty, which is this, If ChriÅ¿t be God, then is he a Mediator of one, for he cannot be a Mediator to himÅ¿elf, and God is but one: if this were a Å¿ound conÅ¿equence, ChriÅ¿t would be Mediator to none at all, and the reaÅ¿on is this, There are but two Parties diÅ¿agreeing, God and man: Now all the Elect in all the world they are reckoned in this account but as one man; Now if ChriÅ¿t be man, took their Å¿eed, then he is of this Party, then he is Mediator to himÅ¿elf, and the words may be retorted, A Mediator is not of one; but if ChriÅ¿t be man, then he is a Mediator of one, for he cannot be Mediator to himÅ¿elf, for all men are but as one, come under one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ideration, and he is among them; if he be a man being of their nature, and true man of their Å¿eed.</p>

               <p>Let the whole text in that place of <hi>Tim.</hi> be conÅ¿idered and duely weighed, together with the ApoÅ¿tles Å¿cope and deÅ¿ign, and with the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ervation of a learned man upon it, and it will prove ChriÅ¿t to be both God and man, and Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator betwixt God and man, for the words in the Greek run thus, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:48559:124"/> tranÅ¿lation of the words; 1.

                  </gap>, but this Article is not prefix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to either of them, therefore neither of them are the Å¿ubject Å¿poken of, but rather they are things that are Å¿poken of an other, which other is the man JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, he is one God, and one Mediator betwixt God and man; and if it be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiÅ¿e then I have held forth, it is quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t the manner of the Greeks, and there will be hardly any place to be found that will pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallell this, where there is Å¿uch an OmiÅ¿Å¿ion.</p>
               <pb n="250" facs="tcp:48559:125"/>
               <p> Now, if it Å¿hould be objected that there is no Article prefixed before the man ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us, which yet I Å¿ay is the Å¿ubject of whom theÅ¿e things are Å¿poken, I anÅ¿wer that there needs not any Article there, becauÅ¿e of the proper names JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, before which the Article is uÅ¿ually pretermitted.</p>
               <p>If we alÅ¿o conÅ¿ider the Å¿cope of the ApoÅ¿tle, it is more congruous thereto, the words being tranÅ¿lated as I have preÅ¿ented; for his degÅ¿in is to prove, that now the Church of God was not to be kept within the narrow bounds &amp; limits of Judea as heretofore, but to conÅ¿iÅ¿t both of Jews and Gentiles, as the verÅ¿e before Å¿hews, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other, <hi>God wil have all to be Å¿aved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth:</hi> But how doth the ApoÅ¿tle prove that? by this fifth ver. he proves it, for, Å¿aith he, the man JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t is one God, and one Mediator betwixt God and men, if the words did run as they are tranÅ¿lated, <hi>For there is one God, and one Mediator betwixt God and man;</hi> there would be no Å¿uch good conÅ¿equence, for there was ever one God, and ever one Mediator betwixt God and men, and yet the Church did not extend beyond the bounds of Judea; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿peaks of God under a new conÅ¿ideration, which was not before, till the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tles times, and that is of the man JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, who is God bleÅ¿Å¿ed for ever more, and
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:48559:125"/> whoÅ¿e work is to unite both Jews and Gentiles into one, as in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 28. <hi>EpheÅ¿.</hi> 2. 11, And when he calls this man JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t one God, it muÅ¿t be taken of <hi>Deus uniens,</hi> God making one in a practicall way, as in <hi>Zach.</hi> 14. 9. The Lord Å¿hall be King in all the earth, and in that day the Lord Å¿hall be one, and his Name one. This Lord is ChriÅ¿ts, for of his Kingdome is this Å¿poken, which Å¿hall be Å¿et up in all the earth, and in that day <hi>(viz.</hi> the day of his regnancy over all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, both Jews and Gentiles, for it is a prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Å¿uch a time) the Lord Å¿hall be one, and his Name one; it is not meant of the oneneÅ¿Å¿e of eÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ence, for the Lord was alwaies one in that Å¿enÅ¿e, but of operation <hi>effectivÃ¨,</hi> he Å¿hall be one, he Å¿hall work alike, and in one manner in all Nations, and Å¿hall make them all one in him, they Å¿hall all Å¿erve him with one Å¿houlder, with one conÅ¿ent. So in this of <hi>Timothy,</hi> God would have all to be Å¿aved, and to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth; for JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t is one God and one Mediator, that is, God uniting all in one, and reconciling all in one; The man ChriÅ¿t is God, and Mediator effecting this. This was foretold long before, but God is come in fleÅ¿h now to accompliÅ¿h it.</p>
               <p>But if this expoÅ¿ition Å¿hould not paÅ¿Å¿e, it is eaÅ¿ie to give another, for it is not denied, but that ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us was and is a man, nor is it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:48559:126"/> but that as Mediator he was a man, and it will be further confeÅ¿Å¿ed, that he could not have been Mediator unleÅ¿Å¿e he had been man; for therefore it was that he took not the nature of Angells, but the Å¿eed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he might be a meet Mediator to reconcile us to God. But the point in diÅ¿pute is, Whether as Mediator he was not more then a man, or then a meer crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and I have already Å¿hewed, that to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate for God, and to God, required more Å¿uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency and ability then can be found in man or any creature.</p>

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:48559:130"/> is the obedience of a meer crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for in that Å¿enÅ¿e he takes it: but the former is true, therefore the later. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿equence in the major PropoÅ¿ition is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ound, the reaÅ¿on is, becauÅ¿e though obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be imputed for righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, yet not Å¿imply and meerly becauÅ¿e it was obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and anÅ¿wered the Law, but becauÅ¿e it was the obedience of Å¿uch a perÅ¿on who was Å¿o great and glorious, as that he was not leÅ¿Å¿e then God, but very God, yet as God he performed it not, but as he was man; but the Godhead inabled the Manhood thereto, and did put the value, and worth, and rate, and price, upon that Å¿ervice of the Manhood.</p>
               <p>Nor do I underÅ¿tand how ChriÅ¿t (if he had been a meer creature) could have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed a righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e that could have been reckoned to another, in as much as it would have been all due, wholely due to God, as from himÅ¿elf being a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, becauÅ¿e of that abÅ¿olute Soveraignty in God over every creature; Nor doe I know how a meer creature-obedience can be imputed for righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e to many millions of creatures, when yet any one of thoÅ¿e creatures to whom it is imputed
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:48559:130"/> muÅ¿t have done as much, and muÅ¿t have Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered as much in reference to his own tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ion, as that doing and Å¿uffering of ChriÅ¿t which is imputed to him amounts to, if ChriÅ¿t be but a meer creature.</p>
               <p>And whereas he Å¿aith, <hi>He could not have obeyed the Law as he was God;</hi> I Å¿ay, he could not (being but one) have obeyed the Law for Å¿o many, if he had not been God. He alÅ¿o Å¿aith, <hi>He could not have Å¿uffered the curÅ¿e of the Law but as he was man.</hi> But I Å¿ay and Å¿hall prove it (I hope) before I fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿h this work, that if the had been no more but man, he could not have Å¿uffered the curÅ¿e of the Law for Å¿o many men.</p>
               <p>The concluÅ¿ion is this, that though a creature obeyed the Law, and a creature Å¿uffered the curÅ¿e of it, yet the perÅ¿on that did both the one and other was not a meer creature, but more then a creature; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e of this perÅ¿on was more then a meere creature righteouÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e.</p>

It is evident from the conteÅ¿t betwixt
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:48559:133"/> ChriÅ¿t and the Scribes, they did not charge ChriÅ¿t (no not in their hearts) with blaÅ¿phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, as conceiving that ChriÅ¿t did not forgive Å¿ins miniÅ¿terially, by the authority which he derived from another, for in that Å¿enÅ¿e they would not have Å¿aid, <hi>Who can forgive Å¿ins but God?</hi> They would not have made it proper to God to forgive Å¿ins, for they knew that the PrieÅ¿ts miniÅ¿terially did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give the Å¿ins of the people, that brought their Å¿acrifices, and the Prophets alÅ¿o in the name of God did it, as <hi>Nathan</hi> did <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids:</hi> nay in this Å¿enÅ¿e they could not attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute it to God at al; for God cannot be the MiniÅ¿ter of any, to pardon Å¿in in anothers name; therefore they looked upon ChriÅ¿t as forgiving Å¿in in his own name, and by his own proper power, and therefore (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving him onely to be a man) they accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed him of blaÅ¿phemy. Now if ChriÅ¿t had been onley a man, and had forgiven Å¿in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿terially, in the name, and by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Father, and not in his own name, nor by his own power, why doth he not declare Å¿o much to them, and tell them that the thing was even Å¿o as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, that no man, nor creature hath hath any abÅ¿olute independent power in himÅ¿elf to forgive Å¿ins, but it is the royall
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:48559:134"/> prerogative of God, as they conceived, but their error lay in this, they were miÅ¿taken in him, they conceived of him that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave Å¿ins in his own name, and by his own proper power; and he did it not, but it was done by a derived power, and in a miniÅ¿te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall way; why was not his way of doing it cleared up to the Scribes by him? when he knew they were right in their thoughts of the thing, onely miÅ¿took his acting, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that he acted what he did not act. But it is apparent that ChriÅ¿t doth conteÅ¿t with them upon another point, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to prove that he the Son of man (though they looked upon him as a meer man, and nothing more) was yet Å¿uch an one, that without blaÅ¿phemie he might take upon himÅ¿elf, as a thing Å¿uitable to him, and very proper to forgive Å¿ins in that very Å¿enÅ¿e, as they called blaÅ¿phemie, that is, in his own name, and by his own power, and authority, without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence upon any other, to whom it more properly belonged, as they concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, in which conteÅ¿t with them he aÅ¿Å¿ert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himÅ¿elf to be the God to whom it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to pardon Å¿in: Therefore ChriÅ¿t charged them with evill thoughts of him, as it is expreÅ¿Å¿ed by <hi>Matthew</hi> in his relating
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:48559:134"/> of the Å¿tory, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 4. not becauÅ¿e they imagined that he exerciÅ¿ed that power which he did not, <hi>viz.</hi> an abÅ¿olute independent power from himÅ¿elf, when as he onely exerciÅ¿ed a delegated power which was derived to him: this was not the cauÅ¿e why ChriÅ¿t challenged them for thinking evill in their hearts, but becauÅ¿e they denied him to have that power which he had, and Å¿aid he blaÅ¿phemed becauÅ¿e he aÅ¿Å¿umed it, and did Å¿o appropriate it to God, whom they conceived a Å¿pirit in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that they denied it to him in fleÅ¿h, as he was the Son of man upon earth in a Å¿tate of exinanition, emptied of his glory. Therefore in <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 6. and Å¿o in <hi>Mar.</hi> 2. 10. there is a concurrence of the EvangeliÅ¿ts, that ChriÅ¿t to convince them of their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, in reÅ¿training and Å¿traightning him in his power, which they would grant to God, but not to him, Å¿peaks theÅ¿e words; <hi>But that you may know that the Son of man on earth, hath power to forgive Å¿ins; I Å¿ay unto thee, ariÅ¿e,</hi> &amp;c. If that had not been the Scribes and PhariÅ¿ees errors, that they granted that to God, which they denied to him, he Å¿hould rather have uÅ¿ed other words then thoÅ¿e words that he did; and have Å¿aid rather, <hi>that you may know, I do not</hi>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:48559:135"/> 
                  <hi>aÅ¿Å¿ume that power which you think I do aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ume;</hi> for Å¿uch words as theÅ¿e would have Å¿uited the Tenent of my AntagoniÅ¿t bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the error of the Scribes, had that been their error: But ChriÅ¿t conteÅ¿ts with them about power, and will make them know that he had a power which they would not grant him, but called it blaÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie, even the very power of God, though he be alÅ¿o the Son of man on earth. And therefore he uÅ¿eth theÅ¿e words, <hi>That ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth.</hi> This conteÅ¿t of ChriÅ¿t with the Scribes puts it out of doubt that ChriÅ¿t challenged to be principall and equal with the Father in pardoning Å¿in, and would not own himÅ¿elf to be miniÅ¿teriall or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trumentall therein.</p>
               <p>2. It appears by this, that ChriÅ¿t is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall in forgiving, becauÅ¿e the Scribes, and PhariÅ¿ees, had no Å¿ooner conceived thoughts of a difference betwixt God and him, denying him to be God, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him with blaÅ¿phemie for aÅ¿Å¿uming that power which was peculiar to God: but while Å¿uch imaginations were in their hearts, ChriÅ¿t (before they could or did ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them) did diÅ¿cover them, and reprove
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:48559:135"/> them: and therein ChriÅ¿t gave a Å¿igne to them, that they had evill thoughts of him while they looked upon him as leÅ¿Å¿e then God, or as below God; for they might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute themÅ¿elves in their own falÅ¿e conceits of ChriÅ¿t. After this manner do we charge this perÅ¿on with blaÅ¿pemie, becauÅ¿e he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives Å¿ins being but a man, and not God, as we have thought, and yet he knows the thoughts of our hearts, and diÅ¿covers that which we had only conceived, and had not uttered, and who can do Å¿uch a thing as this, but God? Whether is it eaÅ¿ier to Å¿ay thy Å¿ins are forgiven thee, or to Å¿ay, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think you evill in your hearts? when we expreÅ¿Å¿ed nothing with our lips. Is it not as great a work to know the heart, as to forgive Å¿ins? Doth not <hi>Solomon</hi> Å¿peak to God after this manner, <hi>Thou onely knoweÅ¿t the hearts of the children of men,</hi> 2 Chron. 6. 30. Certainly, this perÅ¿on (though in fleÅ¿h) is notwithÅ¿tanding more then fleÅ¿h, none other but God. ChriÅ¿t adminiÅ¿tred matter of Å¿uch expoÅ¿tulation to them, that they might correct their former erring thoughts. But if they were not inÅ¿tructed thereby, yet we Å¿hould underÅ¿tand what thence may be collected. The Å¿ame perÅ¿on forgave Å¿ins as diÅ¿cerned hearts: but ChriÅ¿t
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:48559:136"/> not as man, but as God, diÅ¿cerned hearts; therefore not as man, but as God he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave Å¿ins. Nor can it be Å¿aid that ChriÅ¿t knew their thoughts, becauÅ¿e God reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to him, or becauÅ¿e they gave Å¿ome Å¿ignes what imaginations were in them; for <hi>Mark</hi> declares that ChriÅ¿t knew what they thought in and from his own Spirit, that is, by himÅ¿elf, and not from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; therefore he forgave Å¿ins by and from himÅ¿elf, and not by or from any other, <hi>Mark</hi> 2. 8.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is manifeÅ¿t from the Miracle that ChriÅ¿t wrought, that ChriÅ¿t was principall in forgiving, and that by and from himÅ¿elf he did it, and not by power derived to him, for he wrought the Miracle authoritative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and by his own power, he did not work it in his Fathers name, that is, by way of dependence upon him, and by prayer to his Father, as Å¿ometimes he did when he would Å¿hew his manhood, that he was the Son of man, as wel as the Son of God, but he wrought it by command, Å¿pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in his own name, <hi>I Å¿ay unto thee ariÅ¿e, take up thy bed and walk;</hi> and this authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive command cameforth of his mouth, was effectual before their eyes, for this end, that he might confute thoÅ¿e evil thoughts they
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:48559:136"/> had conceived and harboured in their hearts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, <hi>viz.</hi> that he had blaÅ¿phemed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e being but a man, he had arrogated and aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿umed that power to himÅ¿elf, which is proper to God. Had this been the Scribes and PhariÅ¿ees errour, that they thought he took to himÅ¿elf that power which indeed he did not, <hi>viz.</hi> an abÅ¿olute and independent power in remitting Å¿ins, and yet it was but a derived power which he had from another, and that it was not his own which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciÅ¿ed then in the working of this miracle, that they might know that they erred in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions concerning his manner of working; he Å¿hould at this time eÅ¿pecially, rather then at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, by invocation upon his Father have ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected it. And the reaÅ¿on is, becauÅ¿e ChriÅ¿ts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿igne was in working this miracle, to teach them Å¿omewhat which they underÅ¿tood not, and to rectifie their apprehenÅ¿ions concerning himÅ¿elf, as theÅ¿e words import, <hi>That ye may know that the Sonne of man hath power on earth to forgive Å¿ins. I Å¿ay unto thee who art Å¿ick, &amp;c. ariÅ¿e and walk.</hi> Now what was it that he would teach them? was this it, that he did act dependently upon his Father, and had no Å¿uch power of his own to forgive Å¿ins, but derived it from his Father? If Å¿o, was this the means or the way to convince them of it, to command in his own name the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent man that was Å¿ick of Å¿o deadly a diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, to ariÅ¿e and walk, without any looking up to
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:48559:137"/> heaven, or groaning in his Å¿pirit, or Å¿peaking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God his Father to effect it in him or by him? Was it not rather the way to confirme them in their errour (if that were their errour) then to bring them to the knowledg of the truth? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is manifeÅ¿t and clear that he would teach them Å¿ome other thing wherein indeed they er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and Å¿tood in need to be rectified; they thought him but a man, and that he uÅ¿urped that power which belonged not unto him, but was proper to God, and that was to forgive Å¿innes in his own name, and not miniÅ¿terially, but by and from himÅ¿elf; this they called blaÅ¿phemy. Now he would in this rectifie their erring judgements, by working a miracle in his own name, and by a commanding word, accompanied with anÅ¿wera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble power; and therefore Å¿aith, <hi>That you may know that the Son of man,</hi> even he himÅ¿elf hath <hi>power</hi> in himÅ¿elf, and not derived from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>to forgive Å¿ins</hi> I Å¿ay, even I Å¿peak it as one that have authority in my Å¿elf, and need not to Å¿eek out to any other, I Å¿ay, <hi>ariÅ¿e and walk.</hi> This abÅ¿olute and independent way and manner of working this miracle, is a good demonÅ¿tration in what way, and after what manner he forgave Å¿ins; and both by the one and by the other, he would convince the Scribes and PhariÅ¿ees, that he (though clothed in fleÅ¿h, and appearing only as a man) was yet God, equall with his Father, and could work the Å¿ame works of his Father.</p>
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:48559:137"/>
               <p> Now, though ChriÅ¿t Å¿eems to Å¿peak of the act of forgiving Å¿ins as an eaÅ¿ier work then if he Å¿hould Å¿ay to the Å¿ick man, <hi>ariÅ¿e and walk,</hi> as theÅ¿e words of his Å¿eem to import, <hi>Whether is it eaÅ¿ier,</hi> &amp;c. yet the works are both alike, though one not eaÅ¿ier then the other; nor did ChriÅ¿t look upon the one as eaÅ¿ier then the other, nor did the Scribes and PhariÅ¿ees look upon one as eaÅ¿ier then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for they look upon the act of abÅ¿olving from Å¿inne as proper to God; and not appertaining to man; But withall they thought that he deluded the people when he Å¿pake the words, <hi>thy Å¿ins are forgiven thee,</hi> becauÅ¿e the effect was inward, and not to be diÅ¿cerned by the eyes of the body, and Å¿o the people could not diÅ¿cover the fraud and falÅ¿hood in working; therefore they imagined it was farre eaÅ¿ier for ChriÅ¿t to Å¿ay <hi>thy Å¿innes are forgiven thee,</hi> in which he could not be detected, if the effect followed not, then for him to Å¿ay, <hi>ariÅ¿e and walk,</hi> which if he had not had a power anÅ¿werable to that word of command, would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cover his impoÅ¿tures, and expoÅ¿e him to Å¿hame and reproach; in this Å¿enÅ¿e it was eaÅ¿ier for one that would delude, to Å¿ay <hi>thy Å¿innes are forgiven thee,</hi> then to Å¿ay <hi>ariÅ¿e and walk;</hi> but ChriÅ¿t would Å¿hew that the one was as truly wrought and done as the other, and both of them done by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his Godhead.</p>
               <p>There are alÅ¿o other Scriptures which may give light, that ChriÅ¿t in forgiving Å¿ins was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:48559:138"/> and not receiving power from another: 1. ChriÅ¿t gave power to his DiÅ¿ciples, <hi>John</hi> 20. 23. (the place which he quoted) to remit Å¿ins, effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually, Å¿o &amp; as that they Å¿hould be remitted and to retaine Å¿ins effectually, and Å¿o as that they Å¿hould be retained. Now this power of delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting power to others, doth Å¿hew a power reÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elf, and doth Å¿hew that ChriÅ¿t is the principall Lord againÅ¿t whom Å¿ins are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, becauÅ¿e he both conveyes a power to the ApoÅ¿tles, and doth ratifie the exerciÅ¿e of it. 2. The ApoÅ¿tle forgave Å¿ins in the perÅ¿on of ChriÅ¿t in 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 2. 10. that is, he did it inÅ¿trumentally and repreÅ¿entatively, and in the name of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other who was chief in it, and that was ChriÅ¿t. It is not Å¿aid in the perÅ¿on of God, as it Å¿hould have been Å¿aid, if ChriÅ¿t had not been God, and principall in that power of forgiving.</p>
               <p>But he Å¿aith, <hi>It cannot be, becauÅ¿e the Scripture cannot oppoÅ¿e it Å¿elf.</hi> And he preÅ¿ents what Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Tels us, <hi>The Scripture</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>tels us that we are justified by the man JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t,</hi> Acts 13 38, 39. <hi>be it known unto you men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveneÅ¿Å¿e of Å¿innes, and by him all that do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve are juÅ¿tified, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> The Scripture tels us, that through the man ChriÅ¿t we are juÅ¿tified, but the Scripture tels us not that we are juÅ¿tified by ChriÅ¿t as man; It is a granted thing by us all, that the perÅ¿on that
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:48559:138"/> juÅ¿tifies us is man (for we Å¿ay he is both God and Man) But that he juÅ¿tifies as man, or remits Å¿innes as man, is denyed by us, and the contrary hath already been proved; I have Å¿hewed before that the Sonne of man is Å¿aid to be heaven, which was impoÅ¿Å¿ible, becauÅ¿e he was on earth when he Å¿pake theÅ¿e words; the words are therefore thus to be underÅ¿tood, the perÅ¿on, that is, the Sonne of man, being alÅ¿o God, was in heaven at that time, but not as the Sonne of man, but as God, Å¿o in this place it is to be underÅ¿tood.</p>
               <p>There is Å¿ome difference to be made in ChriÅ¿ts juÅ¿tifying of us. If we Å¿peak of the meritorious cauÅ¿e of JuÅ¿tification, whole ChriÅ¿t, and the whole of ChriÅ¿t doth concurre in it, contribute to it, and effect it for God (looking upon that which was done and Å¿uffered, and upon the perÅ¿on, <hi>(viz.</hi> the excellency and glory of the perÅ¿on) that did it, and Å¿uffered it; in which, both the Godhead and the manhood acted the one by obeying, the other by enabling and preÅ¿enting as his (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was) (the union betwixt the two natures conÅ¿idered) pronounced beleevers juÅ¿t upon that account. Not that the manhood of ChriÅ¿t meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but the whole of ChriÅ¿t acted in thoÅ¿e things wher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>in the merit was. But if we Å¿peak of the efficient cauÅ¿e of juÅ¿tification, or of pardon of Å¿inne, ChriÅ¿t conÅ¿idered in his divine nature as God only is agent in it, becauÅ¿e he alone againÅ¿t whom Å¿inne is committed, can from and by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:48559:139"/> acquit and diÅ¿chare therefrom; and Å¿o ChriÅ¿t as God can only do it, and he did it as God, as I have proved from <hi>Mark</hi> 22. 10.</p>
               <p>I conceive that in this Text ChriÅ¿t is not Å¿po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of as the efficient, from whom juÅ¿tification and pardon of Å¿ins comes, but as Mediator through whom, or as the means and merit by whom forgiveneÅ¿Å¿e of Å¿innes comes; in which Å¿enÅ¿e it is Å¿aid that ChriÅ¿t was the Lamb of God which took away the Å¿innes of the world. My reaÅ¿on is, becauÅ¿e it is Å¿aid, <hi>through this man is preached forgiveneÅ¿Å¿e, and by him all that beleeve are juÅ¿tified,</hi> not efficiently, but mediatoriouÅ¿ly and meritoriouÅ¿ly. It is not Å¿aid he pardoned Å¿in, but through him pardon was preached; nor is it Å¿aid he juÅ¿tified, but through him are juÅ¿tified thoÅ¿e that beleeve; that is, through him as the meanes; and herein the manhood is not to be excluded from acting in thoÅ¿e works which God accounts for a beleevers righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to which God juÅ¿tifies; but principally, yea Å¿olely to be acknowledged, but Å¿o farre as concernes the reÅ¿pect that God gives to Å¿uch acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the acceptance that they find with God, which is this, <hi>viz.</hi> God imputes them unto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers as their righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, and for the Å¿ake of them doth pardon their Å¿ins; the manhood is not at all herein to be mentioned. But nothing that can be anÅ¿wered to this can reach the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance, becauÅ¿e this text was impertinent, and I
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:48559:139"/> might have paÅ¿Å¿ed it by, without giving any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wer to it, becauÅ¿e ChriÅ¿ts pardoning of Å¿inne in way of efficiency, is that which the InÅ¿tance or Argument which I produced, intends and proves, and this Scripture diÅ¿ables it not, becauÅ¿e it Å¿peaks of another thing, and not of that.</p>
               <p>But he goes on, and tels us what Scripture Å¿aith farther, <hi>viz. That Christ prayed to another</hi> (on the Jewes befalfe) <hi>for the forgiveneÅ¿Å¿e of Å¿inne, Luke</hi> 23. 34. <hi>Then Å¿aid JeÅ¿us, Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.</hi> Therefore ChriÅ¿t is not the principall forgiver of Å¿ins, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> ChriÅ¿t prayed to another, <hi>viz</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for the forgiveneÅ¿Å¿e of Å¿in, and another prayed to him for the pardon of Å¿in, <hi>viz. Stephen,</hi> and the Jewes were the Å¿ubjects that were pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for in both; What muÅ¿t then be Å¿aid to this? and what anÅ¿wer is to be given to it? Alas it is not difficult to Å¿peak to it. The Scripture hath clearly untyed the knot; If ChriÅ¿t were not a man, he could not pray to another; and if he were nothing more then a man, another could not pray to him; and the Scripture declares both, while it Å¿hewes him to be God and man. As man therefore he humbles himÅ¿elf, he prayes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him that was God. It was a time of Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to ChriÅ¿t, and this was an action of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation in ChriÅ¿t, but as God he was prayed to by him that was a man, and with adoration alÅ¿o,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:48559:140"/> though he was in heaven in reference to his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, he veiled his Godhead when he prayed to God; <hi>Stephen</hi> unveiled it, when he prayed to him. So that there is no good conÅ¿equence in this, that becauÅ¿e both the Scripture and himÅ¿elf do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare him to be man in his praying for the pardon of Å¿ins, therefore Scripture and himÅ¿elf have deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to be God in his pardoning of mens Å¿ins.</p>
               <p>His third Scripture is <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 30, 31. <hi>The God of our fathers raiÅ¿ed up JeÅ¿us, whom ye Å¿lew and hanged on a tree, him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance unto IÅ¿rael, and forgiveneÅ¿Å¿e of Å¿ins;</hi> Hence he collects that ChriÅ¿t received from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other his power of forgiving Å¿ins.</p>

But this anÅ¿wer may be returned unto it. ChriÅ¿t doth fall under a double conÅ¿ideration in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he may be looked upon abÅ¿olutely as the Son of God, and Å¿econd perÅ¿on in the Trinity, as <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and as <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>mmanuel,</hi> God with us, or in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as God manifeÅ¿t in the fleÅ¿h, and as Å¿ent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, and executing the office of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator. If he be conÅ¿idered in the former accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he is eÅ¿Å¿entially Lord; and that one Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver in all the creatures are the works of his giver
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:48559:140"/> hands, and Å¿ubject to him, and every tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ion and Å¿inne that is committed, is againÅ¿t him; and it belongs to him with the Father and the holy GhoÅ¿t (who are one God with himÅ¿elf) to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don Å¿inne, to acquit from the guilt, and to deliver from the curÅ¿e thereof, becauÅ¿e he can turn away his wrath, and hath power over all plagues, and can Å¿ave from them, and Å¿o he receives no power to forgive Å¿ins, but it belongs to him and cannot be Å¿eparated from his Godhead, but is naturally, eÅ¿Å¿entially and eternally his. But if he be conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the latter acception, then many things are derived to him, as the office of MediatorÅ¿hip, and a LordÅ¿hip, and the name Saviour is given him upon that account, which is a name above every name of the Creatures, and Prince and Captaine of our Å¿alvation, is a name put upon him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to him; in this Å¿enÅ¿e it is given to him to give repentance unto IÅ¿rael and remiÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿ins. Now it muÅ¿t be underÅ¿tood as I have expreÅ¿Å¿ed in my former TreatiÅ¿e, that the giving of theÅ¿e things doth not deny any intrinÅ¿ecall or inward perfection which ChriÅ¿t hath, but rather Å¿uppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eth it; and it muÅ¿t be granted, that ChriÅ¿t, to whom theÅ¿e things are given, according to his due nature, hath all his perfection with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the gift of theÅ¿e, and that theÅ¿e are but declarative, and Å¿erve to manifeÅ¿t that eÅ¿Å¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall riches and glory which he had with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from eternity, and that his naturall Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:48559:141"/> and LordÅ¿hip (which cannot be Å¿eparated from his Deity) is that which founds Å¿uch dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and gifts which are too high for any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and would carry away Divine glory from him, who is God, if they Å¿hould be given to any meere creature, and they are to be exerciÅ¿ed by the help of the Godhead of ChriÅ¿t, elÅ¿e they could not be acted by him, as being too great for any man or meere creature. Indeed the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity hath fellowÅ¿hip with the Godhead in the glory of the having and executing theÅ¿e things; and to the manhood it is glory derived, which was not before, but to the Deity of ChriÅ¿t it is glory manifeÅ¿ted and declared only.</p>
               <p>More particularly, It is given to ChriÅ¿t as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator to diÅ¿penÅ¿e pardon of Å¿in, and it belongs to his PrieÅ¿t-hood to do it. The PrieÅ¿ts of the Law they did it, externally and miniÅ¿terially, figurative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and typically; they pronounced clean and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, Å¿o farre as concerned the fleÅ¿h; but ChriÅ¿t did it, and doth it effectually, and Å¿piritually, pronouncing and diÅ¿charging the conÅ¿cience from all Å¿inne; and what was the reaÅ¿on of this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence? They did it as men, therefore in weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, and could Å¿peak, but were not able to effect what they Å¿pake; but ChriÅ¿t did it as the Sonne of God, yea as the eternall Son of God, as the ApoÅ¿tle teÅ¿tifies, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 3. So that the very PrieÅ¿t-hood of ChriÅ¿t, that it might be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall in the works of it (and this of pardoning
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:48559:141"/> of Å¿in, was one of them) was founded in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Son-Å¿hip of ChriÅ¿t, and therein lay this ability and power to performe the works of it, and principally this work of remitting Å¿innes: So that though the way of diÅ¿penÅ¿ing pardon be given to ChriÅ¿t, yet the power of diÅ¿penÅ¿ing was not given, but is as ancient as his Son-Å¿hip; therefore he erres in his inference which he fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from this Text of <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 31. When he Å¿aith, <hi>that he received from another his power of forgiving Å¿ins:</hi> For it was not power that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, but the way of exerciÅ¿ing of it. It is acted in the fleÅ¿h as Mediator, even Å¿ince ChriÅ¿t came in the fleÅ¿h, and now the Son of man, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives Å¿innes, that is, the perÅ¿on that is man and the Å¿on of man forgives, but not as he is man or the Å¿on of man, but as he is God and the Son of God. For though it may be Å¿aid that the Mediator pardoneth Å¿in efficiently, as well as MeritoriouÅ¿ly, as PrieÅ¿t; yet it cannot be Å¿aid that the whole of the Mediator doth it, but the divine nature alone acts in it. It may be Å¿aid of a man who conÅ¿iÅ¿ts of Å¿oul and body, that he me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditateth, but it cannot be Å¿aid of the whole of man that he meditateth, but of the minde only. It may alÅ¿o be Å¿aid of of him that he walketh; but it is to be underÅ¿tood of his body only, and not of his minde, yet becauÅ¿e of the union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt body and Å¿oul (both of them making but one man) what either doth is attributed to the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:48559:142"/> whole. So it is with ChriÅ¿t our Mediator, he bore our Å¿innes as man only, for the God-head could not Å¿uffer, he purged away our Å¿innes as God-man: for the man-hood acted, and the God-head merited, he pardoned Å¿in as God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauÅ¿e he is Å¿upream Lord only as he is God: yet the Mediator doth all theÅ¿e, that is, he that is both God and man doth them; but in this different way he doth them. And Å¿o it appears that Å¿till he is the principall in this work of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving Å¿ins, becauÅ¿e he doth it as God, and that this gift (which reÅ¿pects not the power it Å¿elf of diÅ¿penÅ¿ing, but the way only of diÅ¿penÅ¿ing doth adde nothing to the intrinÅ¿icall perfection of ChriÅ¿t, but is manifeÅ¿tive of that inward eÅ¿Å¿enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all glory, which he had with the Father before any beginning was, which was vailed by ChriÅ¿ts aÅ¿Å¿uming fleÅ¿h, and yet manifeÅ¿ted in fleÅ¿h, by acts which were too high for fleÅ¿h, of which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture this of pardoning Å¿in was one.</p>
               <p>The concluÅ¿ion is this, the work of forgiving Å¿in is high and glorious, proper and peculiar, and Å¿uitable to this great and moÅ¿t high God, JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t; the Mediatorly the way of diÅ¿penÅ¿ing it is below this excellent perÅ¿on ChriÅ¿t, who is not only the Å¿on of the higheÅ¿t, but the higheÅ¿t, and it was the humbling and debaÅ¿ing and empty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of himÅ¿elf to act Å¿uch a work in Å¿uch a way.</p>

All perÅ¿ons which afterward Å¿prung from him, were in his loyns at that time when he Å¿inned, and were parts of him, and conÅ¿equently they Å¿inned in him, and with him, his Å¿inne was their Å¿inne, it extended unto them, and they could not but participate of it, as of <hi>Levi</hi> it is Å¿aid, that he paid tythes in <hi>Abrahams</hi> loynes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 9, 10.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Adams</hi> Å¿tate in which he Å¿tood, when the
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:48559:143"/> whole world was in him, was a Å¿tate of grace and favour with God, from which (if he Å¿inned) himÅ¿elf was to fall and all his poÅ¿terity with him; after the manner of Å¿ome perÅ¿ons that holds an eÅ¿tate, upon the good will of their Lord, whom if they offend they are caÅ¿t out and all their poÅ¿terity with them, for that is the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon which it is given to be poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed, and the children and off-Å¿pring are in volved in the guilt of Å¿uch perÅ¿ons treÅ¿paÅ¿Å¿es, whoÅ¿e favour is on Å¿uch termes; God is to be looked upon as Å¿overaigne Lord of all creatures, to whom it belongs to Å¿hew favour to what creatures he will, and upon what termes he will, and under what conditions he pleaÅ¿eth, and under what pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties (in caÅ¿e of tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ion) liketh him; therefore it was that he Å¿et <hi>Adam</hi> over the works of his hands, entred into a conditionall League and Covenant with him, and did both priviledge him, and reÅ¿train him, and abridge him therein; and this was done under penalty of dying, both to him and his, in caÅ¿e of treÅ¿paÅ¿Å¿e, <hi>thou Å¿halt dye the death</hi> (Å¿aith God) to him. And thus it came, that through the offence of one, many are dead.</p>
               <p>3. Sinne was propagated and generated to and in <hi>Adams</hi> poÅ¿terity, after that <hi>Adam</hi> fell, and loÅ¿t Gods image. It is Å¿aid of him that begat a Å¿on after his own image, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. 3. And Å¿o all perÅ¿ons came to be conceived in iniquity, and to
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:48559:144"/> be borne in Å¿in, for out of an unclean thing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is clean can proceed. And Å¿o it comes to paÅ¿Å¿e, that <hi>Adams</hi> Å¿inne made many tranÅ¿greÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ours; for by propagation all men have Å¿ins of their own (over and above the Å¿inne of <hi>Adam,)</hi> imputed to them. Thus the paÅ¿Å¿age of Å¿in and death, from one <hi>Adam</hi> to all men, appears facile and eaÅ¿ie; there is no obÅ¿truction in the way, Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty and holineÅ¿Å¿e and juÅ¿tice, and truth furthered it, effected it.</p>
               <p>But now in reference to ChriÅ¿t it cannot be thus aÅ¿Å¿erted, that righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e paÅ¿Å¿eth upon men after this manner. 1. RighteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e is not propagated at all, but only imputed. 2. It is not by participation, becauÅ¿e none are in ChriÅ¿ts loynes by nature: ChriÅ¿t hath no naturall Å¿eed, that are parts of him. 3. If there be any Å¿uch relation betwixt ChriÅ¿t and men<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> as that ChriÅ¿t Å¿hould be a father to them, and they children to him, that he Å¿hould be as a Å¿econd <hi>Adam,</hi> it is not unto all, but to thoÅ¿e only that beleeve and this is alÅ¿o meerely through grace, and Å¿o there may be an imputation of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e from one to many, but it is through grace. Therefore it is Å¿aid, the grace of God hath abounded by one man unto many: Not unto all men, but to all that receive it, that do beleeve, <hi>verÅ¿.</hi> 17. 4. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be imputed through grace, there comes to be an obÅ¿truction to it; juÅ¿tice and truth muÅ¿t be Å¿atisfied, before there be any place for grace;
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:48559:144"/> and if grace cannot paÅ¿Å¿e, the gift of grace which is righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e and life to men through ChriÅ¿t, cannot paÅ¿Å¿e neither. And Å¿o it appears that the way of Å¿ins paÅ¿Å¿ing is more ready from one man to many, then the way of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding through one to many. BecauÅ¿e of Å¿atisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that muÅ¿t interpoÅ¿e, that grace may have a free and open paÅ¿Å¿age unto many. 5, If it be through Å¿atisfaction, that muÅ¿t interpoÅ¿e, before the grace of God, and the gift by grace can by one abound to many; and if firÅ¿t the Å¿ins of thoÅ¿e many, that grace abounds to, through one, muÅ¿t be laid upon that one, that that one might bear the curÅ¿e of the Law, that by this means the grace of deliverance (which conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e imputed, and in life,) might paÅ¿Å¿e o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, through that one, and abound to thoÅ¿e ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, (as he himÅ¿elf (though Å¿omewhat darkely) doth confeÅ¿Å¿e) then this one man (through whom grace muÅ¿t abound to many) cannot be any one, but Å¿uch an one who is able to give Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for many. And concerning this Å¿atis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction the querie is made, how it could be that any one meer man could Å¿atisfie for the Å¿innes of many tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ours; and the diÅ¿proportion is pleaded: <hi>No proportion betwixt one meer man dying for Å¿in, and many men Å¿inning and deÅ¿erving death, each of them for the Å¿ins they have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi> But he makes no anÅ¿wer at all unto it, but Å¿ends me to <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 15. to anÅ¿wer my Å¿elf, which
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:48559:145"/> Å¿leight proceedings will Å¿atisfie none but Å¿uch who are willing to be deluded by him.</p>
               <p>The queÅ¿tion only will be, what Å¿atisfaction is neceÅ¿Å¿ary, that grace may abound to many? BecauÅ¿e there be many that conceive that any Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction will Å¿erve (to make man capable of grace) which God will accept, and they do not look at proportion. And there are others that hold that no Å¿atisfaction at all is neceÅ¿Å¿ary, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pect of God, becauÅ¿e God having loved the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, loves them for ever, and there is no change at all in Gods love, nor is God capable of chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but is immutable in his nature; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though man Å¿inned, yet his love was not broken off thereby; nor was there any breach on his part at all, nor did ChriÅ¿t dye to Å¿atisfie him at all; for he was Å¿atisfied always in his own love, which continued the Å¿ame after man had Å¿inned as before; for in his love he gave ChriÅ¿t after man had tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ed; therefore the breach was on mans part; he had wronged God, and merited nothing but hatred, and wrath, and all evill, and no love at all; and having an evil and guilty conÅ¿cience, he was Å¿uÅ¿picious of God, and expected no good from him, but feared all evil, and could not conceive how God could love Å¿uch a creature, or Å¿hew any grace or favour to him, that had Å¿inned in Å¿uch Å¿ort againÅ¿t him; and knew not how God could do it without Å¿atisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; Thus unÅ¿atisfied was mans conÅ¿cience
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:48559:145"/> (having Å¿inned) concerning the finding of any mercy from Gods hands; therefore God gave ChriÅ¿t and delivered him up to death, and layed him under the curÅ¿e of the Law, not to Å¿atisfie himÅ¿elf thereby, but to Å¿atisfie mans conÅ¿cience, and to give reÅ¿t and quiet to it, and that God cared not for a few drops of bloud, but there was a wound in the conÅ¿cience of thoÅ¿e that had Å¿inned, that would not be healed but by Å¿uch a manifeÅ¿tation of the Fathers love, as in giving ChriÅ¿t, and delivering him up for Å¿uch, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And Å¿ome Å¿ay ChriÅ¿t came to reveal the Fathers councells, and dyed for the confirmation of them. This opinion takes hold of many, and Å¿preads and prevailes much; my deÅ¿igne is not to make a large diÅ¿courÅ¿e in way of anÅ¿wer, becauÅ¿e it is beÅ¿ide my preÅ¿ent undertaking; only becauÅ¿e I am neceÅ¿Å¿itated (in reply to him) to inÅ¿iÅ¿t a little on the point of Å¿atisfaction, and becauÅ¿e the point is of great concernment, I Å¿hall not overÅ¿leightly paÅ¿Å¿e over it, but Å¿tay a while in anÅ¿wer to both the forementioned Tenents, and Å¿hall firÅ¿t Å¿hew that Å¿ome Å¿atisfaction to God is neceÅ¿Å¿ary, and then declare what it is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> And firÅ¿t I Å¿hall premiÅ¿e Å¿ome things, and afterward lay down Å¿ome poÅ¿itions.</p>
               <p>That which is to be premiÅ¿ed, is: 1. That there are no paÅ¿Å¿ions and affections in God, after the manner of men; there is neither love nor hatred, nor wrath, nor anger, nor joy, nor
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:48559:146"/> grief, nor any Å¿uch by which the mindes and Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of men are moved and diÅ¿turbed; for God had all things before him at firÅ¿t that Å¿hould come to paÅ¿Å¿e afterward; and if it were good, it was of his own operation; and if it were evill, it was of his own permiÅ¿Å¿ion and ordering alÅ¿o, and that which he could eaÅ¿ily have prevented. So that it is irrationall to conceive that God Å¿hould be Å¿tirred or moved with any thing that comes to paÅ¿Å¿e, or that he Å¿hould be in divers tempers or mindes, or that he Å¿hould be one thing to day, and an other thing to morrow; this is inconÅ¿iÅ¿tent to that abÅ¿olute bleÅ¿Å¿edleÅ¿Å¿e of God; therefore though theÅ¿e things are Å¿poken of God in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, yet they be <hi>humanitus dicta,</hi> they be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to God after the manner of men. And thoÅ¿e things that are paÅ¿Å¿ions and affections in men<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> are attributes and decrees, and counÅ¿els, and actions and operations in God; and imply not the leaÅ¿t mutation or change in God. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple, Gods loving of <hi>Jacob</hi> before he had done good to deÅ¿erve Å¿uch a thing, what was it but Gods goodneÅ¿Å¿e and graciouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e; which is an attribute in God, noted in decreeing <hi>Iacob</hi> to glory, which is called Election; and Gods hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to <hi>EÅ¿au</hi> before he had done evill, what was it but his Å¿overaignty and abÅ¿olute domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which God hath over the creatures, without being capable to give any account, exerciÅ¿ed i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="293" facs="tcp:48559:146"/> they are not paÅ¿Å¿ions and affections in God, but they are acts of the unchangeable will of God, in which the above mentioned properties in God are expreÅ¿Å¿ed. And Gods wrath and anger is not a paÅ¿Å¿ion in God, but it is an act of Gods righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e and juÅ¿tice, by which he repells that which is evill in the creature, and contrary to his own holineÅ¿Å¿e, in teÅ¿tification of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿uitableneÅ¿Å¿e of it to him, and of that which he juÅ¿tly expects from the creature.</p>
               <p>2. There is difference to be put betwixt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree and purpoÅ¿e of God, concerning life and glory, in reference to Å¿uch perÅ¿ons whom he will glorifie goodneÅ¿Å¿e towards, and the way and means by which God will effect it and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliÅ¿h it, which is in advancing holineÅ¿Å¿e and righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e; in order to which he made the firÅ¿t <hi>Adam</hi> after his image, gave him an holy and righteous nature, writte his will in his heart, and then entred into a Covenant of life and peace, and glory with him upon the obÅ¿ervation of his will; and threatened death, and all evil, and miÅ¿ery, upon the violation thereof; and this Covenant was in reference to himÅ¿elf, and his poÅ¿terity that were in his loyns. This latter is called in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture the way of peace and life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 16, 17. The former is hid in God; for who hath been of his counÅ¿ell, or who knoweth further then he reveals? and it hath its being in God, and no where elÅ¿e. The latter is declared to the creature
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:48559:147"/> and it is the creatures capacity of life, or the viÅ¿ible Å¿tate of life into which God did put him, and it hath its being in the creature.</p>
               <p>3. There is difference to be put betwixt the love of God to the creature, and the amity of God with the creature; or betwixt the decree of grace in electing the creature to life and glory, &amp; the proÅ¿ecution of the decree in Å¿uteable and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable actings of God toward the creature.</p>
               <p>If there be a right diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hing betwixt theÅ¿e things that thus differ, theÅ¿e following propoÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and concluÅ¿ions will be better underÅ¿tood and more eaÅ¿ily granted.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When Å¿in was committed againÅ¿t God, the love of God was not broken off, nor the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, purpoÅ¿e and thoughts of God, concerning glorifying of Å¿uch perÅ¿ons whom he had choÅ¿en to life and glory, were not altered, nor changed; for this foundation Å¿tands Å¿ure, the Lord know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth who are his, nor is God in this Å¿ence like man that he Å¿hould repent: ThoÅ¿e whom he thus loveth, he loveth to the end, that is, he cannot caÅ¿t off whom he hath choÅ¿en. For theÅ¿e councells of grace concerning theÅ¿e perÅ¿ons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without reÅ¿pect either to good or evill in the perÅ¿ons themÅ¿elves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 11. The good or evill that followed them in Å¿uch perÅ¿ons, could neither confirme them nor overturne them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e they Å¿tand upon this baÅ¿is, the immutable and unchangable Will of God, not upon the
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:48559:147"/> uncertain and wavering creature; and hence it came to paÅ¿Å¿e, that when one means of effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, <hi>viz</hi> mans own righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e proved ineffectual, God (to Å¿hew his firmeneÅ¿Å¿e in his Councels) found out other means to accompliÅ¿h them by <hi>viz.</hi> the righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e of another, and therefore gave ChriÅ¿t, <hi>John</hi> 3. 16.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though Å¿inne did not, could not overturn the Decree of life, yet it broke the Covenant of life, and Å¿o overthrew that viÅ¿ible Å¿tate of life in which the elect were, whom God had choÅ¿en; and Å¿o brought them into a dreadfull viÅ¿ible Å¿tate of death, though not into a final miÅ¿erable Å¿tate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e of Gods election. Sin altered the Å¿tate of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect perÅ¿ons, though it altered not Gods thoughts concerning them; Å¿o that it might be Å¿aid, he that was before in the Å¿tate of Å¿alvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, is now through Å¿in in the Å¿tate of condemnation; though it cannot be Å¿aid that God will (becauÅ¿e of Å¿in) now damn that perÅ¿on, whom his thought and purpoÅ¿e was to have Å¿aved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 11. <hi>DeÅ¿truction and miÅ¿ery is in their paths;</hi> and ver. 23. <hi>All have Å¿inned and fallen Å¿hort of the glory of God</hi> and Rom. 5. 12. <hi>As by one man Å¿in entred into the world, and death by Å¿in, Å¿o death paÅ¿Å¿ed over all men, becauÅ¿e all had Å¿inned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Sin having overthrown the Covenant of life and glory, and brought men into the Å¿tate of death, all hope and expectation of life was (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with it) taken away, and nothing but a fearfull expectation of death and condemnation.
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:48559:148"/> It is Å¿aid of <hi>Adam</hi> when he had Å¿inned, that he hid himÅ¿elf from God, when God came into the Garden, as one that expected no good from Cod.

               <p n="4">4. Though the election of God Å¿tand Å¿ure, and the Å¿ove of God could not be broken off, yet the amity and friendÅ¿hip of God was brought to an end, and wrath was manifeÅ¿ted inÅ¿tead of love, and God inÅ¿tead of proÅ¿ecuting his Decree of life, proÅ¿ecutes the breach of the Covenant of life, which was violated by Å¿in; and ratifies the threatning, which was this, <hi>thou Å¿balt Å¿urely die;</hi> and doth unfold the curÅ¿e in it, and open it in Å¿ome part of its latitude, which was Å¿hut up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theÅ¿e generall words, <hi>thou Å¿halt die,</hi> Gen. 3. 16. to 20.

               <p n="5">5.

God hath, Å¿aith he, Å¿et forth ChriÅ¿t to declare his righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, that he might be juÅ¿t, and the juÅ¿tifier of them that beleeve in JeÅ¿us. God had regard to both theÅ¿e in Å¿ending and Å¿etting forth ChriÅ¿t, that he might juÅ¿tifie thoÅ¿e that he had choÅ¿en, and had brought to faith; and that he might be juÅ¿t in Å¿o doing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e the Å¿inne that Å¿uch had commited, or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipated in, was worthy of death by Gods owne dome; therefore God minds both, that goodneÅ¿s and righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e might be exalted together in the Å¿ame ChriÅ¿t. So in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. 13.

ChriÅ¿t therefore died not for any Å¿uch end as to ratifie the doctrine which he had brought from the Father; for by his miracles he gave Å¿ufficient witneÅ¿Å¿e thereto, nor is this made the end of ChriÅ¿ts dying any where in Scripture; but it was to appeaÅ¿e God, and to fulfill righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e.</p>

Scarcely for a righteous man would one die, that is, Å¿carcely in Å¿tead of him, to deliver him from death; and Å¿o in application to ChriÅ¿t for us, is as much as in his roome, and place, and Å¿tead, which further appears, becauÅ¿e firÅ¿t the very evils which were due to us ChriÅ¿t endured, as firÅ¿t the wrath of God in his Å¿oule, Å¿uch which the very damned have in hell, but more intolerable; it is Å¿aid that his Å¿oul was heavy unto death, and that on a cold winters day, he did through the meere an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiÅ¿h of his Å¿oule, and while he was conflicting with Gods anger, Å¿weat drops of water and blood, notwithÅ¿tanding all the Å¿upport he had, which was his fathers immediate Å¿troke; for no hand was upon him at this time but Gods; and it was the torment of the mind that had Å¿uch an influence upon his body, for his body was put to no paine. Now this wrath was upon him, becauÅ¿e wrath was due to us, we were children of wrath, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 3. 2. He endured the curÅ¿e of the law; and was not the curÅ¿e of the law our portion for tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ion? <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 10. 3. He Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered

And by death it was that he delivered us from the fear of death, to which we were in bondage, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 15. Now if he Å¿uffered in Å¿tead of us, then it was in a Å¿atis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory way, becauÅ¿e our Å¿ufferings would have been to Å¿atisfie the law, and Gods juÅ¿tice which is in the law; and the damned in hell do Å¿uffer for that reaÅ¿on, to pay that debt to juÅ¿tice, which becauÅ¿e they can never compleatly do, therefore they do ever Å¿uffer.</p>

But redemption in a proper acception, hath Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in it; for it may be thus deÅ¿cribed, Redemption is a freeing a captive from the hands of him that detains him, by a price given unto him; as when a perÅ¿on is taken captive by the Turks, there is a price given to him for the freeing of Å¿uch a perÅ¿on. So it is in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption effected by ChriÅ¿t, on the behalfe of the Elect; and there are theÅ¿e following parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars in it.</p>

And by ChriÅ¿t it is Å¿aid that we receive the attonement that is with God, or we have God attoned to us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 11. for all the offerings of the Old TeÅ¿tament were for attonement, and the people offered them to attone him; God did not offer them to attone them or reconcile them; nor did they offer them to Å¿how that they were reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to God; for they were offered immediately after they had Å¿inned, and had the Å¿enÅ¿e of their Å¿inne upon their conÅ¿ciences, and knew they had angred God; that by offering them in a beleeving way, looking at ChriÅ¿t the Å¿inne-offering (which they Å¿ignified) they might appeaÅ¿e him and paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him, and Å¿o might have peace in their owne hearts.</p>

There are many diÅ¿Å¿imilitudes betwixt the one redemption and the other; and this is one, that there is no price paid in the one but power uÅ¿ed, but in the other there was both. And to convince of this the better, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ider, the one was without blood, for there needed none; but the other muÅ¿t be with blood,

And the reaÅ¿on of this difference is, becauÅ¿e <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es</hi> had not in the redemption of <hi>IÅ¿rael,</hi> any thing to do with an offended God, who had a controverÅ¿ie againÅ¿t the people whom <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> was to redeem, and from whom he would have Å¿atisfaction before he would Å¿ave them; for then in Å¿uch a caÅ¿e againÅ¿t the enemy that held them, power would not have been Å¿ufficient for their deliverance, but a price would have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; but ChriÅ¿t in his redemption hath to do with Gods wrath, and anger, and with Gods righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, which were Å¿hewed and reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againÅ¿t the Elect; for the Elect had Å¿inned, whom he was to redeem; and God had threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned they Å¿hould die the death, and they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erved it, and God muÅ¿t be juÅ¿t and true in what he had Å¿aid; therefore ChriÅ¿t muÅ¿t firÅ¿t pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with God in the deliverance of this people, before he could exerciÅ¿e any power agalnÅ¿t the
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:48559:156"/> devil, or death, or hell; and this prevailing muÅ¿t be by a price paid to Å¿atisfie for tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ion; for it could not be by power; God might be appeaÅ¿ed, but overcome he could not be, as thoÅ¿e enemies muÅ¿t, whom he was to deliver the Elect from. THis hath all been Å¿hewed already, and this is it that makes the diÅ¿parity betwixt the two deliverances which do typifie one the other.</p>

               <p>It is aÅ¿Å¿erted in Scripture that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption in Scripture is never Å¿aid to be from God, as it muÅ¿t needs be, were any price paid to God, or Å¿atisfaction given to God; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is Å¿aid to be from Satan, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. from death, <hi>Heb,</hi> 2. 14, 15. from the power of darkneÅ¿Å¿e, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 13. from our vain converÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18. from iniquity, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14. yea it is Å¿o farre from being a redemption from God, that it is a redemption to God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Redemption in Scripture, though it be nowhere Å¿aid in Å¿o many words to be from God, yet it is Å¿aid to be from the wrath of God, from the judgement of God, from the curÅ¿e of God; the Laws curÅ¿e is Gods curÅ¿e, and Å¿o in a Å¿enÅ¿e redemption is from God, as an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy and an Avenger; it is from God as a Judge, whoÅ¿e office is to Å¿earch out iniquity, and to paÅ¿Å¿e Å¿entence according to the Law, and hath his officers to attend upon him, to whom he delivers up the Å¿inner and offender; from God as Å¿uch an one the redemption of
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:48559:156"/> ChriÅ¿t is, but not from God in reference to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, intereÅ¿t, communion, fellowÅ¿hip, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, dependance, power, and diÅ¿poÅ¿e, &amp;c. for in all theÅ¿e reÅ¿pects redemption is to God, and not from him.</p>
               <p>Though Redemption be from Sin, Satan, the world, death, hell, and all Å¿uch enemies and evils, yet it is to be underÅ¿tood, that it is from theÅ¿e only as the leÅ¿Å¿e principal cauÅ¿es of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of Gods Elect in bondage; even as when a perÅ¿on is delivered from the Gaole, he is delivered from the Gaoler, &amp; from the daungeon or pit into which he was caÅ¿t, and from his bolts, and chains, and from all the noiÅ¿omeneÅ¿Å¿e, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineÅ¿Å¿e, and naÅ¿tineÅ¿Å¿e, that attends that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; yet theÅ¿e are but the leÅ¿Å¿e principal cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es of the evils; he is firÅ¿tly and principally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from his Creditor and the Judge, that committed him to theÅ¿e; So it is in this caÅ¿e; God is the principal perÅ¿on that detains, and the reÅ¿t that are mentioned in Scripture are but his Å¿ervants. The devil is as the officer that receives perÅ¿ons that are Å¿entenced of God into his cuÅ¿tody; Å¿in is but as the fetters and cords in which Å¿uch perÅ¿ons are held, the world is but as the priÅ¿on, and death is but as the torments perÅ¿ons are put to; but properly we are Gods Captives, and are doomed and Å¿entenced of God to baniÅ¿hment from his preÅ¿ence, as <hi>Cain</hi> was, and are delivered up to the power and diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:48559:157"/> of the God of this world; For 1. God is the Soveraign Lord, and Å¿upream Monarch and Judge, and the power primarily belongs to him to caÅ¿t body and Å¿oule into hell. 2. Men are guilty of that which they call <hi>crimen laeÅ¿ae maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statis,</hi> or treaÅ¿on againÅ¿t divine MajeÅ¿ty; <hi>AgainÅ¿t thee, thee only I have Å¿inned,</hi> Å¿aid <hi>David,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore worthy to be rejected.</p>
               <p>3. Therefore they are by nature children of wrath, <hi>The wrath of God is revealed from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi> Upon thoÅ¿e that beleeves not, <hi>the wrath of God abides;</hi> 4. We ask to be loÅ¿ed and diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from our Å¿ins, not from Satan, but from God, and to be loÅ¿ed from the bonds and Å¿nares of hell and death; therefore primarily we are held in bondage to God, and not to Satan or any other. Hereto agrees the witneÅ¿Å¿e of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>God hath Å¿hut up all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all,</hi> Rom. 11. 32. <hi>The Scripture,</hi> that is God in the Scripture, <hi>hath Å¿hut up all under Å¿inne, that the promiÅ¿e of faith through IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t might be given unto them that beleeve,</hi> Gal. 3. 22. <hi>God gave Å¿ome up to vile affections,</hi> Rom. 1. 26. <hi>and verÅ¿e</hi> 28. <hi>becauÅ¿e they liked not to retain God in their thoughts, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God gave them up to a reprobate mind, God gave them up to worÅ¿hip the HoÅ¿t of Heaven,</hi> Acts 7. 42. The Parable of the King that was wrath with him that was unmerciful to his fellow-Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, is pertinent to the Å¿ame purpoÅ¿e, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:48559:157"/> him to the tormentors, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 34. And that exhortation of ChriÅ¿t, <hi>To agree with our adverÅ¿ary while in the way, leÅ¿t the Judge de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver to the officer, &amp;c.</hi> Which places do all Å¿hew that we through Å¿in are primarily the Captives of God, as a King and Judge offended; and that only Å¿econdarily we are Captives to the devil and other enemies as to Gods MiniÅ¿ters and Servants, though enemies, to which we are committed; for without commiÅ¿Å¿ion and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿Å¿ion we are taught, that the greateÅ¿t tyrants can effect nothing againÅ¿t Gods Elect; and the very devils themÅ¿elves, could not go into the herd of Å¿wine without leave; therefore the price paid to God to Å¿atisfie him is the principal thing in redemption.</p>
               <p>It is alÅ¿o to be underÅ¿tood, that theÅ¿e two, <hi>To be redeemed from God, and to be redeemed to God,</hi> will conÅ¿iÅ¿t very well together; for the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of the Elect, is not like the captivation of a perÅ¿on taken in war, and detained by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, from whom when he is redeemed, he is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally alienated and Å¿eparated, and hath no more to do with him: nor is it like the captivation of a perÅ¿on, who is violently and unjuÅ¿tly detained in the hand of a cruel one, who tyrannizeth over him after the manner of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who laid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juÅ¿tly heavy burdens upon the children of <hi>IÅ¿rael,</hi> from whom (if he be once freed) he is totally withdrawn from Å¿uch an one, and divided, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:48559:158"/> to come into his hands or power any more. But the captivity of the Elect is as when a Å¿ubject for Å¿ome offence againÅ¿t his Prince, is delivered into the Serjeants hand, or into Å¿ome other of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers cuÅ¿tody and power, to be impriÅ¿oned, or Å¿courged, or puniÅ¿hed with death, according to the nature of the offence, unleÅ¿Å¿e Å¿atisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be given, and he be releaÅ¿ed upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; Å¿uch a redemption as this is, <hi>viz.</hi> of a Å¿ubject from the wrath of his Prince, is not the alienation of the Å¿ubject from his Prince, but the reconciliation of him to his Prince; and the perÅ¿on that is redeemed from, is redeemed to man; for theÅ¿e do conÅ¿iÅ¿t well enough together, from the wrath and juÅ¿tice of the Prince, to the love and favour of the Prince he is redeemed. And though God offended, doth deliver the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to enemies, and not to Å¿ubjects; for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is an enemy both to God and to the Elect, and not a Å¿ubject, yet this makes no difference but that the Elects captivation may fitly be reÅ¿embled captivation of a Å¿ubject to his own Prince, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e God is the Lord of devils, and they as truly Å¿ubject, (though not as willingly Å¿ubject) as any other that are under Gods power.</p>

                  <hi>Object.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>It is further aÅ¿Å¿erted, that it is God that gave ChriÅ¿t to redeem men, and if there be any Å¿atisfaction given to God by ChriÅ¿t, God himÅ¿elf is the author of it, and gave it to himÅ¿elf; if he gave it to himÅ¿elf, he was Å¿atisfied before,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:48559:158"/> and the price moves him nothing, to releaÅ¿e the captive, becauÅ¿e it is not from the captive, but from himÅ¿elf, and of his own providing; and nothing is added to God by it, for it is but Gods Å¿atisfying of himÅ¿elf. And what a kinde of Å¿atisfaction is this? In the truth of the thing it is as no Å¿atisfaction; for if the Å¿atisfaction muÅ¿t come out of himÅ¿elf, he is Å¿atisfied in himÅ¿elf, without any Å¿atisfaction from the captive.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> God muÅ¿t be looked upon as one that dearly loves the captivated elect perÅ¿ons, who had Å¿inned againÅ¿t him, and would not have them periÅ¿h; and withall he muÅ¿t be looked upon as one that dearly loved juÅ¿tice and truth, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Å¿uffer either of them to be violated; for they are himÅ¿elf, as dear to him as himÅ¿elf; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he provides that JuÅ¿tice and Truth, and the life and welfare of Å¿uch poor captives, may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iÅ¿t together; and becauÅ¿e he Å¿ees it impoÅ¿Å¿ible by any thing that the electcan do, who had offended, becauÅ¿e they are without Å¿trength, and can make no Å¿atisfaction for any treÅ¿paÅ¿Å¿e, therefore he himÅ¿elf in his wiÅ¿dome and love to the Elect, and in his love to JuÅ¿tice and Truth, findes out a way to Å¿ave them from ruine, and to Å¿atisfie theÅ¿e. And that is by ChriÅ¿t, whom he Å¿ends; and this is all his deÅ¿igne, and he lookes for no further gain, nor advantage to himÅ¿elf, but that his goodneÅ¿Å¿e and righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e and truth might be glorified together, in the Å¿alvation of the Elect,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:48559:159"/> that had Å¿inned; for what Å¿tandeth God in need of, and what can be given to him for Å¿atisfaction, which may be added to his Å¿tore? If his juÅ¿tice and truth in reference to his law be maintained, and kept on foot, with his love to thoÅ¿e whom he hath choÅ¿en, this is more to him then all the earth and the fulneÅ¿Å¿e of it; and other Å¿atisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he looks for none. The declaration of his juÅ¿tice and truth is Å¿atisfaction enough, and a motive Å¿trong enough to let the captive go free, and this he obtained by the intervention of the death and blood of his Son. What advantage had <hi>Zaleucus,</hi> who made a law that adulterers Å¿hould loÅ¿e both their eyes, and he to Å¿atisfie this law, that he might be accounted juÅ¿t and impartiall therein, when his Å¿on (whom he loved had offended by adultery) cauÅ¿ed one of his Å¿ons eyes, and another of his own, to be put out, Å¿ave only the praiÅ¿e of his juÅ¿tice and truth in his lawes? and this is that which God grieves at. And if the Judge, loving the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oner that is before him, and knowing he hath nothing to pay, and yet the law recovers pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will give his own Å¿on to be his Å¿urety, and will lay the debt upon him, and is content that his Å¿on Å¿hall fetch the price out of his own trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure, yet the law is Å¿atisfied, and the judges righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e in reference unto it, and his love to the PriÅ¿oner are glorified.</p>
               <p>Nor is the Å¿atisfaction the leÅ¿Å¿e, becauÅ¿e God
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:48559:159"/> the offended perÅ¿on procures it, and not man that offended him; for the truth of God Å¿tands firme by that means, and the law takes place, and is not made of none effect, as it would have been, had no Å¿atisfaction been given, which would have redounded to Gods diÅ¿honour; Yea, the righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e of God and his love to undeÅ¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creatures Å¿hines forth, becauÅ¿e the Å¿atisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is of Gods own procuring.</p>
               <p>And though it proceed from God, yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Å¿aid that God Å¿atisfies himÅ¿elf, or that he was Å¿atisfied before; for he that provides it, doth not act it, but it is acted in and by an other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on. The Father Å¿ends the Son, and the Father in the Son receives Å¿atisfaction; and though the Father and Son be the Å¿ame God, yet they are not the Å¿ame perÅ¿on, nor is the Å¿atisfaction that the Son gives (materially conÅ¿idered) given in the divine nature, or God-head, but the Sonne took fleÅ¿h, and in that fleÅ¿h by dying and Å¿heding his blood, gave Å¿atisfaction; Å¿o that it is from God, but not in God, if we Å¿peak of the next and immediate Å¿ubject, which is the man-hood, if the matter of the Å¿atisfaction be reÅ¿pected.</p>
               <p>And though it may be Å¿aid that God was Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied before in reference to his own love to Å¿uch perÅ¿ons, he did not repent of it in Å¿uch Å¿ort as to caÅ¿t them off, nor was his purpoÅ¿e of glorifying them one whit Å¿haken, yet he was not Å¿atisfied after they had Å¿inned, and after he had Å¿enten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:48559:160"/> them to death, in point of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e and truth, to paÅ¿Å¿e by their tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ion without Å¿atisfaction; his Law was not Å¿atisfied in a free forgiveneÅ¿Å¿e without Å¿atisfaction, and Å¿o God was unÅ¿atisfied, becauÅ¿e the Law was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>It is likewiÅ¿e aÅ¿Å¿erted, that there is an unÅ¿atisfied conÅ¿cience in men; men having Å¿in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, cannot diÅ¿cerne how Gods heart can be towards them without Å¿atisfaction; therefore the Scripture Å¿peaks of propitiation through ChriÅ¿ts bloud, and of atonement by his death, conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cending therein to mans infirmity, which could not otherwiÅ¿e apprehend how God could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate life and glory to men after they had Å¿inned, without being firÅ¿t appeaÅ¿ed and pacified by ChriÅ¿ts blood: But if things be rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿idered in themÅ¿elves, as in truth they are, ChriÅ¿t dyed not to reconcile us to God, but to heal us of an evill conÅ¿cience, and that we might know that God loved us after we had Å¿inned, as well as he did before, by the gift of ChriÅ¿t, who is the manifeÅ¿tation of the Fathers love after the fall which the Elect could not be perÅ¿waded of, but by a pledge of it; Therefore it is Å¿aid that ChriÅ¿t Å¿hed his bloud to purge our conÅ¿cience from dead works, to Å¿erve the living God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. and not to Å¿atisfie God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> It will readily be confeÅ¿Å¿ed, that it was an end of ChriÅ¿ts dying, to reconcile men to God, and that they might have the anÅ¿wer of a good
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:48559:160"/> conÅ¿cience before God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. But that this was the Å¿olitary end, or the principall end, or that Å¿atisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to God is no end, but is wholly excluded, is denyed, and hath been diÅ¿proved all along in the diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courÅ¿e upon this Å¿ubject.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What need would there have been that ChriÅ¿t Å¿hould have dyed at all, if only Å¿atisfaction to mens conÅ¿ciences concerning Gods goodneÅ¿Å¿e and love to fallen creatures had been intended therein. For God could beÅ¿t have done that by his Å¿pirit, and muÅ¿t yet do it by his Å¿pirit, if it be ever done in the hearts of men. Indeed God having given ChriÅ¿t, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him up to death, the Å¿pirit repreÅ¿ents it as a great manifeÅ¿tation of the Fathers love, but the Å¿pirit might have abundantly aÅ¿Å¿ured the heart of a Å¿inner of the Fathers love without it, Å¿o that there was no neceÅ¿Å¿ity of ChriÅ¿ts dying in that regard.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The love of God repreÅ¿ented unto men in giving ChriÅ¿t, is much leÅ¿Å¿ened to them in the repreÅ¿entati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if ChriÅ¿t were only given to Å¿atisfie their hearts in reference to their fears of God, &amp; not to Å¿atisfie Gods juÅ¿tice; if there were no need of ChriÅ¿t, in reference to any danger they were in, in regard of God, if God could or would have pardoned Å¿in without him, and his juÅ¿tice and truth could have remitted it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is derogatorie to Gods wiÅ¿dome and love to aÅ¿Å¿ert that ChriÅ¿t was delivered up to be crucified upon the croÅ¿Å¿e, and there to Å¿hed his blood princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally for this end, to cure mans panique fears and his groundleÅ¿Å¿e, cauÅ¿eles Å¿uÅ¿picions of God, and not from any neceÅ¿Å¿ity that there was in mans evill condition,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:48559:161"/> in regard of Å¿in committed by him, and of Gods righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e and truth proÅ¿ecuting it againÅ¿t him. For God might have done this in an eaÅ¿ier way, and have Å¿pared his dear Son. God is repreÅ¿ented prodigall of his dear Sons bloud, if he muÅ¿t die and bleed out his Å¿pirits, to cure Å¿ome falÅ¿e conceits that men have entertained of God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. What need was there that the Son Å¿hould come in fleÅ¿h, and Å¿hould empty himÅ¿elf of his glory, and that he that is the Lord of glory Å¿hould be crucified, if no Å¿atisfaction to divine juÅ¿tice was looked at, but only the Å¿atisfaction of the conÅ¿cience? the bloud of God (as it is called) would not have been neceÅ¿Å¿ary, but the bloud of a meer creature ChriÅ¿t, would have Å¿erved the turne for Å¿uch a purpoÅ¿e, had that been all.</p>
               <p n="5">5. How came thoÅ¿e fears in the heart of man after the fall, after Å¿inne committed? What bred them? was there no ground for them? were they meer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts and jealouÅ¿ies that wanted a right bottom? did not the threatning before Å¿inne was committed, cauÅ¿e the horrours and terrours that were in the Å¿oul after Å¿inne was committed? and if they had Gods threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as the ground of them, <hi>viz. in the day thou eateÅ¿t thereof, thou Å¿halt dye the death,</hi> were they not well grounded? and was it poÅ¿Å¿ible that theÅ¿e fears Å¿hould be cured by the bloud of ChriÅ¿t, and the cauÅ¿e not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by the bloud of ChriÅ¿t, the threatning not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, the truth of God and his righteouÅ¿nes not fulfilled and Å¿atisfied, which were in the threatning and which bred the feares?</p>
               <p n="6">6. TheÅ¿e fears and terrors of the Elect, before ChriÅ¿ts
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:48559:161"/> bloud be brought to their hearts to remove them, are they not of the Å¿ame nature with the horrours of the reprobate in hell? And if Å¿o, are not both the one and the other that wrath of God which God poures into the Å¿oul becauÅ¿e of Å¿inne which he proÅ¿ecutes againÅ¿t men? are they not puniÅ¿hments for Å¿in from God? is not Gods righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e therein revealed againÅ¿t Å¿in, &amp; the truth of God in the threatning fulfilled, which did reach to both Elect and Reprobate? And if Å¿o, how can God remove them from the Elect through ChriÅ¿t, without Å¿atisfaction given by ChriÅ¿t, and yet Å¿uffer them to lie upon the Reprobate, without pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable unrighteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e and untruth, when the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>viz. Thou Å¿halt dye the death,</hi> extended to all mankinde in <hi>Adams</hi> loynes without exception?</p>
               <p n="7">7. How may Scripture come to be eluded, and the Å¿trength and force of it infringed in all other caÅ¿es, if plain pregnant places of it may be evaded after this manner, as when it is Å¿aid, God hath Å¿et forth ChriÅ¿t to be a propitiation, that is, to be one that appeaÅ¿eth God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. and by ChriÅ¿t we have received the attonement; <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 11. that is, we have received God attoned to us; for all the offerings in the Law were to attone God to men that had Å¿inned, if Å¿uch an anÅ¿wer may be taken and may paÅ¿Å¿e: <hi>God doth in theÅ¿e expreÅ¿Å¿ions condeÅ¿cend to mans infirmity, who thinks God to be angry, and had need to be appeaÅ¿ed and reconciled;</hi> how eaÅ¿ie would it be to wreÅ¿t and pervert all Scripture? By this that hath been repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ented, it appears that Å¿ome Å¿atisfaction to God is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to be given by ChriÅ¿t, and the contrary
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:48559:162"/> doctrine is dangerous and deÅ¿perate, and overthrows our juÅ¿tification; for if God be not Å¿atisfied for our Å¿ins, they are not pardoned, and we are yet in our Å¿ins; and this doctrine that thus oppugnes ChriÅ¿ts Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, doth deny ChriÅ¿t to have bought us; for if he payed not any price to God for us, I am Å¿ure he paid none to the divel, nor to any other enemy; for he conquered them by force and power and might, and paid not any price to them; therefore it utterly overthrows ChriÅ¿ts purchaÅ¿e of the Elect; and yet (which is much to be lamented) this doctrine Å¿preads very much and corrupts very many.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 2. The Å¿econd thing that I promiÅ¿ed to Å¿peak to, is this, that Å¿eeing Å¿ome Å¿atisfaction muÅ¿t be given to God, in reference to a treÅ¿paÅ¿Å¿e committed, and an offence taken, and a threatning given out upon Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ition, and afterward inflicted upon the perpetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Å¿uch an evill, what Å¿atisfaction it is that is neceÅ¿Å¿arie: whether any Å¿atisfaction will Å¿erve, or whether it muÅ¿t be a proportionable Å¿atisfaction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. It cannot be denyed but that God is the Å¿overaigne Lord over all, and hath none above him to appoint him, or to enjoyne him, to give rules and laws to him, how he ought to walk towards the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; none can limit or reÅ¿traine him, or Å¿et bounds unto him; but his will (which is always holy and juÅ¿t and good) is the rule that he acts by; and he doth whatÅ¿oever pleaÅ¿eth him, <hi>PÅ¿.</hi> 115. 3. &amp; further then he Å¿ets bounds to himÅ¿elf, he cannot be bound up to any thing, or by any one; and further then he reÅ¿trains and limits himÅ¿elf, he cannot be reÅ¿trained and limited
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:48559:162"/> by any other. Therefore he might at the firÅ¿t (if it had pleaÅ¿ed him) have pardoned Å¿in without Å¿atisfaction; or he might have accounted that for Å¿atisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, which himÅ¿elf would accept for Å¿atisfaction, be it more or leÅ¿Å¿e; and Å¿o the blood of bulls and goats might have Å¿atisfied as well as the blood of a man, and the blood of a meer man (Å¿uch as my AntagoniÅ¿t would have ChriÅ¿t to be) as well as the blood of ChriÅ¿t who is God and man; but this comes not home to the point; for we are to conÅ¿ider what Å¿atisfaction is now neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ary, &amp; not what might at firÅ¿t have been accepted of.</p>
               <p>2. Satisfaction that will now be admitted of and accepted, is Å¿atisfaction according to the Law, that holds proportion to it; for the Law is Gods Law, which flowed from Gods righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e and holineÅ¿Å¿e, and in which, and to which, God hath limited himÅ¿elf, and bound up himÅ¿elf, Å¿o that God muÅ¿t deny his own Law, and his own Truth, righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e and holineÅ¿Å¿e that is in it, if he do in the leaÅ¿t kind wave that Å¿atisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that it requires. Now the law to <hi>Adam</hi> (which compriÅ¿eth all his poÅ¿terity) was, <hi>Thou Å¿halt not eat,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for if thou do eat, thou Å¿halt Å¿urely dye; &amp; that Å¿oul that Å¿ins, Å¿hall dye; and curÅ¿ed is every one that continues not in all things written in the Law, to do the Å¿ame.</hi> Therefore the Å¿atisfaction could not have been leÅ¿Å¿e then death, or leÅ¿Å¿e then the curÅ¿e of the Law, what ever that evil is that is underÅ¿tood by death, or by the curÅ¿e.</p>
               <p>3. What ever that evill is that reprobated, perÅ¿ons doe or Å¿hall endure, upon whom the curÅ¿e of the law is laid, and the death threatned, lighteth becauÅ¿e they were in <hi>Adams</hi> loynes, when he fell under the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:48559:163"/> of death, and becauÅ¿e they continued not in all things written in the Law, and Å¿o incurred the curÅ¿e; I Å¿ay what ever the anguiÅ¿h, torture and torment is, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in mind or body, which Å¿uch perÅ¿ons paÅ¿s, or muÅ¿t paÅ¿s, abide, or muÅ¿tabide under at preÅ¿ent, or hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the like puniÅ¿hment in all degrees, without any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement, have the Elect merited and deÅ¿erved, being in the Å¿ame Å¿tate and condition with the Reprobate, being equally in the loynes of <hi>Adam</hi> with him, and not abiding any more then he did in all things writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Law; and if there be deliverance for the Elect, and the Law in the death and curÅ¿e of it be not laid, nor doth light upon them, but Å¿atisfaction is made in ChriÅ¿t for them, then it muÅ¿t be a proportionable Å¿atisfaction that muÅ¿t be given to God, in reference to which God doth remit Å¿uch pains of hell, Å¿uch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaÅ¿ting deÅ¿truction and perdition, and doth releaÅ¿e the Elect from them; that is, ChriÅ¿t muÅ¿t Å¿uffer the whole, and the full, of that which either any, or all the Elect have deÅ¿erved and from which they are acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and diÅ¿charged in ChriÅ¿t; ChriÅ¿t muÅ¿t Å¿atisfie as far as the guilt of all and every of the Elect extends to, which is as great as the light of the Reprobate, and Å¿o ChriÅ¿ts Å¿ufferings in one kind or other, muÅ¿t be equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to the eternal damnation of all the Elect, from which they are diÅ¿charged by his Å¿ufferings, equivalent unto thoÅ¿e exquiÅ¿ite torments which the damned in hell do, or Å¿hal Å¿uffer, which the Elect had merited as well as they.</p>
               <p>The conÅ¿equence of this, is, that ChriÅ¿ts Å¿ufferings were not the Å¿ufferings of a meer man; for had ChriÅ¿t
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:48559:163"/> been but a meer man, his Å¿ufferings for all the Elect could not have been proportionable to their guilt &amp; demerit. For the righteous God (which without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pect of perÅ¿ons, had laid all men under the Å¿ame curÅ¿e and wrath, becauÅ¿e of the Å¿ame Å¿in and guilt, which without difference, all were under) could not Å¿ave by ChriÅ¿t without tranÅ¿mitting that curÅ¿e and wrath which was due to all and every of the Elect to ChriÅ¿t and if ChriÅ¿t had been but a meer man, then there would have been need of Å¿o many ChriÅ¿ts to have Å¿uffered and endured as there are Elect perÅ¿ons; and every one of theÅ¿e ChriÅ¿ts muÅ¿t have Å¿uffered hel, <hi>viz.</hi> the torments of hell as well as death, and then they muÅ¿t have Å¿uffered ever alÅ¿o, without any end, and yet could not have juÅ¿tified the Elect, becauÅ¿e while they Å¿hould be Å¿uffering till that be ended, God could not be Å¿atisfied; and if God could not be Å¿atisfied, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect could not be juÅ¿tified and diÅ¿charged, and Å¿o to all eternity the Elect could not be acquitted; and this appears in ChriÅ¿t, if he had Å¿uffered and had never got through his Å¿uffering we had never been Å¿aved; if he had dyed, and had never riÅ¿en, we had never riÅ¿en to life and glory.</p>
               <p>And this is that which I preÅ¿ented, in that Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or InÅ¿tance (as he calls it) of mine, <hi>viz. that the Å¿atisfaction which ChriÅ¿t gave to Gods juÅ¿tice is deÅ¿troy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if ChriÅ¿t be but a meer man and not God; for how could the blood of aman Å¿atisfie for the Å¿ins of many tranÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greÅ¿Å¿ours, whereas there is no proportion betwixt one meer man dying for Å¿in, and many men Å¿inning and deÅ¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving death, each of them for the Å¿ins they have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?</hi>

That which is unconceivable, and wants the authority of Scripture Å¿o to countenance it, is not receivable. So did not the doctrine of the Trinity; for though it be an incomprehenÅ¿ible myÅ¿tery, yet it is not an unÅ¿crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural doctrine, but it is compaÅ¿Å¿ed about with a cloud of witneÅ¿Å¿es, both of the old and new TeÅ¿tament, which do declare it with the greateÅ¿t clearnes; but that Å¿uch a thing Å¿hould be in ChriÅ¿ts MediatorÅ¿hip, that that which is finite in nature &amp; value, Å¿hould yet Å¿atisfie for that which is infinite in provocation and offence, hath neither the light of reaÅ¿on, nor the truth of Scripture to draw out conÅ¿ent unto it, &amp; therfore is worthy to be expunged out of the Saints beliefs. 3.

It is called a greater Tabernacle, becauÅ¿e it was not of this building, not framed of the Å¿eed of male and female<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> as other bodies are, but of another building, as the ApoÅ¿tle obÅ¿erves, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 11. conceived in the wombe of a Virgin, by the over Å¿hadowing of the Holy GhoÅ¿t; and it was greater alÅ¿o, becauÅ¿e, not the glory of the Lord filled it only, as it did the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle made in the wilderneÅ¿Å¿e, but becauÅ¿e the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the Godhead dwelt in him bodily, and by this greater Tabernacle he obtained eternal redemption for us, and entred into heaven to take poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of glory for us. Why did not God delight in burnt-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but ChriÅ¿t muÅ¿t come? the reaÅ¿on is rendred, it was to do the Will of God.

               <p>If ChriÅ¿t be a meer creature, then a Å¿acrifice finite in value, wil be able to Å¿atisfie an infinite juÅ¿tice offended; but a Å¿acrifice finite in value, cannot Å¿atisfie an infinite juÅ¿tice offended; <hi>ergo</hi> ChriÅ¿t is not a meer crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>He anÅ¿wers not to either of theÅ¿e propoÅ¿itions, nor indeed can do, without running into abÅ¿urdities; for firÅ¿t the conÅ¿equence is firme and good, which will be manifeÅ¿t if theÅ¿e five things be made out. 1. That the
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:48559:167"/> Å¿acrifice of a meer creature neither is nor can be any other then finite in value, which none wil doubt of, if they conÅ¿ider that a meer creature is only finite, and can be nothing more; and if Å¿o, then the actings of it are according to the nature of it finite alÅ¿o, both in their nature, and in their value &amp; worth; for nothing can act beyond it Å¿elf; and this I beleeve he will not deny. 2. That the juÅ¿tice of god is infinite, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e it is an attribute of God, and is God (for what ever is in God is God) muÅ¿t needs be granted, becauÅ¿e God himÅ¿elf is infinite; and indeed God cannot be compounded of things that are finite; for an infinite being is never made up of finite things, Å¿o that all in God is infinite. And that which is finite, is limited; and that which is limited, is limited by another which is greater then it, and can limit it; but both theÅ¿e are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent to God, who is greater then all, &amp; limits all, but is limited of none. 3. That this infinite juÅ¿tice was offended, which is manifeÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e 1. a juÅ¿t and holy law was broken; 2. a righteous and juÅ¿t penalty propoÅ¿ed to warn man leÅ¿t he Å¿hould tranÅ¿greÅ¿s, was Å¿leighted and deÅ¿piÅ¿ed; 3. man was immediately upon the tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ion judged and Å¿entenced with death, and expulÅ¿ed ParadiÅ¿e; 4 becauÅ¿e this law was Gods which was tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ed, and the penalty that was threatned and was deÅ¿piÅ¿ed, was Gods alÅ¿o, therefore the offence in tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ing and deÅ¿piÅ¿ing was infinite, though not in the nature of it, yet in relation to Å¿uch a God who is infinite; which will farther appear, if this be granted, which in reaÅ¿on cannot be denied, that faults co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mitted receive their aggravation as from
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:48559:167"/> the matter and manner of committing, and from the end and deÅ¿ign, Å¿o from the object or perÅ¿on againÅ¿t whom committed; the greater &amp; more excellent the perÅ¿on is, againÅ¿t whom the tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ion is, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ion; therfore if againÅ¿t a Prince, it is an high aggravation, and it counted treaÅ¿on, and a more grievous death is inflicted; and if it be an high crime againÅ¿t him, it is endeavoured that his death may be perpetuated; therefore his torments are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed, and this is judged righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons that inflict Å¿uch puniÅ¿hment in reference to Å¿uch tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ion; and yet the higheÅ¿t of men are perÅ¿ons that muÅ¿t die, and their breath is in their noÅ¿trils; and they are not only finite, but their life is like bubbles upon the water, and in compariÅ¿on of God they are but as Wormes and GraÅ¿hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. What then if the fault be againÅ¿t God, who is the Prince of all Princes, and before whom the higheÅ¿t is but as the duÅ¿t of the ballance, who is infinite in his nature and in all his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes; the guilt of Å¿uch a fault will be according to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on, infinite, as the perÅ¿on is; and hence it is that it cannot be expiated by perÅ¿ons that commit a fault againÅ¿t God, no not by Å¿ufferings; therefore the wicked and ungodly Å¿uffer for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, becauÅ¿e they can never Å¿uffer enough, in any time; to give Å¿atisfaction to God for their tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ion, therefore they muÅ¿t always Å¿uffer, and there muÅ¿t be infinity in their Å¿uffering, Å¿o far as they are capable of infinity; we Å¿ay that that which hath no end, is infinite; but the Å¿ufferings of the Reprobate have no end; This comes from the JuÅ¿tice of the infinite God, which in puniÅ¿hing the creature that Å¿ins againÅ¿t him, conÅ¿iders the infinite diÅ¿tance that is betwixt him and it, and makes the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿hment proportionable, which made <hi>Eli</hi> Å¿ay to his Å¿ons, <hi>If a man Å¿inne against a man, the Judge Å¿hall judge him, but if man Å¿inne against the Lord, who Å¿hall intreat for him?</hi> the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance is Å¿uch that there is no mediatour that the creature can find out for him, but he is puniÅ¿hed with everlaÅ¿ting deÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:48559:168"/> from the preÅ¿ence of the Lord. 4. That Å¿acrifice is Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that was ordained of God to Å¿atisfie the juÅ¿tice of God, which muÅ¿t needs be confeÅ¿Å¿ed, if it can be proved that God was attoned, appeaÅ¿ed, pacified by Å¿acrifice, and that tranÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greÅ¿Å¿ions againÅ¿t God, which carry infinite guilt in them are remitted by them; but this is manifeÅ¿t from many places of Scripture, <hi>Lev.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>and chap.</hi> 4. 26, 31, 34. and divers others. 5. The Å¿acrifice that ChriÅ¿t offered to God, when he offered himÅ¿elf to God, was Å¿ufficient to Å¿atisfie Gods juÅ¿tice, though infinitely wronged, and offended by the Elects tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ions, <hi>Rom</hi> 8. 33, 34. <hi>Who can lay any thing to the charge of Gods E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect? it is God that juÅ¿tifieth;</hi> but how can that be when Å¿o juÅ¿t and Å¿o holy a law hath been tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ed, and the juÅ¿tice of God calling upon God for Å¿atisfaction? The ApoÅ¿tle anÅ¿wers it in the next words, <hi>Who can condemne? it is ChriÅ¿t that died, or rather that is riÅ¿en again.</hi> This imports that ChriÅ¿t by dying hath given Å¿uch Å¿atisfaction that nothing can condemne; the Law that was tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ed cannot, Gods juÅ¿tice cannot, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 26. <hi>Christ hath once in the end of the world appeared to put away Å¿in by the Å¿acrifice of himÅ¿elf,</hi> and ver. 12. <hi>ChriÅ¿t by his own blood entred once into the holy place, having obtained eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal redemption for us.</hi>

               <p>The minor PropoÅ¿ition or the AÅ¿Å¿umption is undeniable, and needs no proof, which is this; <hi>A Å¿acrifice finite in value, cannot Å¿atisfie an infinite juÅ¿tice offended;</hi> for there muÅ¿t be Å¿ome proportion betwixt the offence by which infinite juÅ¿tice is ingaged againÅ¿t perÅ¿ons that commit it, and the Å¿atisfaction that is tendred and given to juÅ¿tice Å¿o ingaged, in reference to tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ion; but what proportion betwixt a finite Å¿acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a finite value and vertue, and infinite juÅ¿tice moved, Å¿tirred, offended, and ingaged againÅ¿t men?</p>
               <p>Now unto this Argument there is no anÅ¿wer returned, but Å¿ome little arguing there is againÅ¿t an infinite Å¿acrifice, which is rather a denying of the concluÅ¿ion, then an anÅ¿wering to any premiÅ¿e of the Argument.

                  <hi>Repl.</hi> And doth not the Scripture tell us, that the perÅ¿on that was made this Å¿in-offering was God? therefore his bloud is called <hi>the bloud of God,</hi> Acts 20. 28. was the Lord of glory; therefore it is Å¿aid, <hi>had they known him, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory:</hi> now this is the Title of the moÅ¿t high God, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 24. 7. PÅ¿al. 29. 3. Was the great Shepherd of the Å¿heep; yea the chief Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd; which is equivalent to the moÅ¿t high God: for the moÅ¿t high is familiarly in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture called a Shepherd. <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 23. 1, and <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 80. 1. And if Å¿o, then he is chief Shepherd; and if chief Shepherd, then ChriÅ¿t is he, becauÅ¿e there are not two chief Shepherds, but one chief Shepherd; and Å¿o the Father and ChriÅ¿t are one and the Å¿ame chief Shepherd. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 20. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 4. The great or chief Shepherd is Å¿aid to be brought again from the dead by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Å¿o that the perÅ¿on that was this Å¿in-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:48559:169"/> was as great, as high, as excellent, as can be imagined; as high as the higheÅ¿t, infinitely high and great, as theÅ¿e Scriptures do declare; for Å¿uch a perÅ¿on according to the fleÅ¿h that he aÅ¿Å¿umed, was crucified, did Å¿hed his bloud, was raiÅ¿ed again by the Father, in Å¿ome places of Scripture, by himÅ¿elf in other; for the Father and he work the Å¿ame works; the Father raiÅ¿eth the dead, yea the dead body of ChriÅ¿t; and the Son raiÅ¿eth the dead, and his own dead body alÅ¿o; as hath been Å¿hewed before.</p>
               <p>Yea further, Doth not the Scripture tell us, that ChriÅ¿t through the eternal Spirit offered up himÅ¿elf without Å¿pot to God, and that his blood in this regard is made more effectual for the purging away of Å¿in, than the bloud of Bulls and Goats? <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. <hi>How much more</hi> (Å¿aith the ApoÅ¿tle) <hi>Å¿hall the bloud of ChriÅ¿t, who through the eternal Spirit offered up himÅ¿elf to God, purge your ConÅ¿ciences from dead works to Å¿erve the living God?</hi> In this Scripture here is both the Sacrifice and the PrieÅ¿t that offered it. ChriÅ¿t according to his Humanity is the Å¿acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; it was himÅ¿elf according to the FleÅ¿h that was offered up: and ChriÅ¿t according to his Divinity or Deity was the PrieÅ¿t that offered up him according to the FleÅ¿h. It is Å¿aid that ChriÅ¿t did it through the Eternal Spirit; What is this Eternal Spirit? It was not the Å¿oul of ChriÅ¿t; for firÅ¿t, The Å¿oul of ChriÅ¿t is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:48559:169"/> eternal, no more then he will grant the Å¿ufferings of the creature in hell to be infinite; and yet they never Å¿hall have end: that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly eternal which neither hath beginning nor ending, and Å¿o cannot be meaÅ¿ured: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nothing can be Å¿aid to be paÅ¿t, and nothing future and to come, in that which is eternal; and eternity is one of the Attributes of the moÅ¿t high God, and incommunicable to the creature; though Å¿omtimes that which hath no end is Å¿aid (but very improperly) to be eternal.</p>
               <p>2. The Å¿oul of ChriÅ¿t may be Å¿aid to be a part of the Å¿acrifice that ChriÅ¿t offered up to God by or through the eternal Spirit; for though he Å¿uffered in the fleÅ¿h, and Å¿hed his bloud according to the fleÅ¿h, yet he Å¿uffered in the Å¿oul, bore the wrath of God in the Å¿oul, and the curÅ¿e of Å¿in lay upon the Å¿oul as well as upon the body; therefore the Å¿oul as well as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was in a Å¿enÅ¿e offered up to God; and therefore both of them are diÅ¿tinct from the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Å¿pirit that is here Å¿poken of, by which it is Å¿aid he offered up himÅ¿elf; that which was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and that by which it was offered, are different things from one another. 3.

<pb n="340" facs="tcp:48559:170"/> Å¿ame nature both the one and the other: But where is Å¿uch an Adjective added to them in Scripture, as Eternal?</p>
               <p>Nor can the Spirit of God be meant by this eternal Å¿pirit; for ChriÅ¿t in reference to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Å¿pirit, is made the PrieÅ¿t and the Efficient that offered up to God that which was offered up, <hi>viz.</hi> the whole Humane Nature of ChriÅ¿t conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of Å¿oul and body; though Scripture Å¿peak moÅ¿t of the body in which he dyed and Å¿hed his bloud. For this Pronoun <hi>who,</hi> points at Å¿omthing in ChriÅ¿t beÅ¿ides Å¿oul and body which was offered to God; which did Å¿lay the Å¿acrifice, and offer it up: and this can be nothing but the eternal Å¿pirit in ChriÅ¿t, the Deity of ChriÅ¿t, by which Å¿pirit he went and preached to the Å¿pirits in priÅ¿on in the days of <hi>Noah,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had either Å¿oul or body; and by which Å¿pirit he Å¿earcheth the heart, which the Å¿oul of ChriÅ¿t cannot do: and the Å¿pirit of God it was not, becauÅ¿e ChriÅ¿t is Å¿poken of in thoÅ¿e places, and not the holy GhoÅ¿t. Nor can it be Å¿aid that he offered up himÅ¿elf by another Å¿pirit that was not his, but by his own Å¿pirit; as it is Å¿aid, that he entred into heaven not by other bloud which was not his, but by his own bloud, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 12. BeÅ¿ides, this offering up of himÅ¿elf through the eternal Å¿pirit, is that that is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to put the value upon the offering up of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf to God, above all the legal Sacrifices; for
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:48559:170"/> otherwiÅ¿e, the bloud of a man is no more to God than the bloud of a beaÅ¿t: but the perÅ¿on in reference to this eternal Å¿pirit, is more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and glorious than all other creatures either men or beaÅ¿ts; in which regard his fleÅ¿h is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a greater and more perfect Tabernacle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e this eternal Å¿pirit dwelt in it, and filled it with glory. By the bloud of this perÅ¿on he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.</p>
               <p>And this is the formal reaÅ¿on and cauÅ¿e whence it came to paÅ¿s that the Å¿ufferings of ChriÅ¿t, which both in Å¿oul and body were finite and received an end, for he Å¿uffered once, and doth not alwaies Å¿uffer; yet are able to expiate Å¿ins which carry infinite guilt in them, being againÅ¿t an infinite God; and are able to free millions of perÅ¿ons from Å¿ufferings; which are as it were eternal and infinite, becauÅ¿e they would not have any end, if ChriÅ¿t by Å¿uffering had not diÅ¿charged from them; for otherwiÅ¿e it would be utterly impoÅ¿Å¿ible that by one Å¿acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice or offering he Å¿hould for ever perfect them that are Å¿anctified, but it would have been as when the high PrieÅ¿t offered up daily the Å¿ame Å¿acrifices, becauÅ¿e Å¿in could not be taken away by one Å¿acrifice: but it is this eternal Å¿pirit that doth put the worth, and value, and merit into this one Å¿acrifice: therefore it is Å¿aid that every PrieÅ¿t Å¿tandeth daily miniÅ¿tring and offering up
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:48559:171"/> the Å¿ame Å¿acrifices, which can never take away Å¿in; But this man after he had offered one Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for Å¿ins, for ever Å¿ate down on the right hand of God, expecting from henceforth till his enemies be made his foot-Å¿tool: <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 11, 12, 13. As one that hath done a work that hath great merit, deÅ¿ert, and worth in it expects a reward, looks that things Å¿hould be Å¿o and Å¿o done to him; Å¿o ChriÅ¿t after he had offered one Å¿acrifice, Å¿ate down, expecting the enemies to be Å¿ubdued at his feet: which had the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been of himÅ¿elf a meer man, he could not have done; for what is man that he Å¿hould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erve any thing of God?</p>
               <p>Now becauÅ¿e the word merit doth reliÅ¿h ill in reference to ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elf with many, and becauÅ¿e all Å¿uch who are againÅ¿t Å¿atisfaction by ChriÅ¿t, or at leaÅ¿t againÅ¿t full Å¿atisfaction, are much more againÅ¿t merit, becauÅ¿e there is no Å¿uch word found in Scripture, therefore I Å¿hall clear up the Doctrine of ChriÅ¿ts merit from the Scripture.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Scripture teÅ¿tifies that ChriÅ¿t hath made a purchaÅ¿e; <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. <hi>Feed the flock of God which he hath purchaÅ¿ed with his own bloud:</hi> this is Å¿poken of ChriÅ¿t, who is called God; and he is Å¿aid to purchaÅ¿e the Church with his bloud. The Church is called a purchaÅ¿ed poÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion. <hi>EpheÅ¿.</hi> 1. 14. The Jews were called a people peculiar by purchaÅ¿e; Å¿o in the Original:

<pb n="344" facs="tcp:48559:172"/> in their own perÅ¿ons had done it; the reaÅ¿on is, becauÅ¿e if men having Å¿inned againÅ¿t God, had been able to Å¿atisfie the Law to the utmoÅ¿t, in reference to their Å¿in they had committed againÅ¿t it, and had done it, yet they could have merited nothing from God, becauÅ¿e Å¿uch Å¿atisfaction was due from them who had Å¿o offended, and it would be but the paying of a juÅ¿t debt; but if an innocent one will come in for another, and this not only out of his reÅ¿pect to the delinquent or offending perÅ¿on, but alÅ¿o to accompliÅ¿h the will of the offended perÅ¿on, this is not debt, this could not be required; there is not any Law that requires an innocent one to Å¿uffer; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here is deÅ¿ert and merit.

               <p n="3">3. There is a Covenant entred into betwixt God and ChriÅ¿t voluntarily on both Å¿ides, in which Å¿omthing is required and condeÅ¿cended to upon condition; in which reÅ¿pect it may be Å¿aid, that ChriÅ¿t having done the works requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, deÅ¿erves the accompliÅ¿hment of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion agreed on; as <hi>Jacob</hi> having Å¿erved for a wife, might Å¿ay, Give me the wife which I have Å¿erved for: which yet cannot be aÅ¿Å¿erted in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the Covenant of God with <hi>Adam;</hi> for though it was of works, yet thoÅ¿e works

               <p n="5">5.

The myÅ¿terie of ChriÅ¿t is not Å¿een in it; it warms not, heats not, quickens not the heart in love, nor by it are perÅ¿ons able to know what it is they Å¿tumble at. It is the knowledge of thoÅ¿e that care not what they know; who behold that which appears above ground, but wil not dig for knowledge as for Å¿ilver: Such who reÅ¿t themÅ¿elves contented with Å¿uch a knowledge, are never like to know that love of ChriÅ¿t that paÅ¿Å¿eth knowledge. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 10.</p>

<pb n="350" facs="tcp:48559:175"/> or made by the Father, is not material; a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on may be Å¿aved without it.</p>
               <p>But Å¿uch aÅ¿Å¿ertions are detrimental to god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineÅ¿s, Å¿erve to nouriÅ¿h up ignorance of God and ChriÅ¿t, and the myÅ¿terie of the GoÅ¿pel in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal perÅ¿ons, who have been wont to Å¿ay, what need is there of Å¿o much knowledge? to know my Å¿elf a Å¿inner, and that ChriÅ¿t dyed for me, is enough; and ChriÅ¿t rebukes it, and makes the Scribes and PhariÅ¿ces aÅ¿hamed of it, when he asks them whoÅ¿e Å¿on ChriÅ¿t was; and when they Å¿aid <hi>David</hi>'s; he demands how it could be, when <hi>David</hi> in Å¿pirit called him Lord? but they were confounded and were not able to anÅ¿wer him. Their general know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that ChriÅ¿t was <hi>David</hi>'s Å¿on, without a right perception of his Divinity, in which reÅ¿pect he was <hi>David</hi>'s Lord, was no better then Å¿hameful ignorance, (Å¿eeing God had revealed both the one and the other) both in them and us.</p>
               <p>In the cloÅ¿e of his anÅ¿wer he deals with a Scripture which I produced to prove that the Å¿atisfaction and merit that was in ChriÅ¿ts bloud, was from the Å¿ubject perÅ¿on whoÅ¿e bloud it was; it is called <hi>the bloud of God, Acts</hi> 20. 28. And indeed he deals injuriouÅ¿ly with it, and evilly intreats it. His words are theÅ¿e.</p>
               <p>I Å¿hall offer theÅ¿e few things to conÅ¿ideration.</p>
               <pb n="351" facs="tcp:48559:175"/>
               <p> There may be Å¿ome miÅ¿take in it, God may be put for ChriÅ¿t or Lord, and then the words muÅ¿t be thus read; <hi>to feed the Church of ChriÅ¿t which he hath purchaÅ¿ed with his own bloud.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And why may there be a miÅ¿take? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e (Å¿aith he) the Churches of the Saints are called the Churches of ChriÅ¿t, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 16. and there is poÅ¿Å¿ibility, probability, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility to countenance it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> 1. Logicians have been wont to Å¿ay, <hi>a poÅ¿Å¿e ad eÅ¿Å¿e non valet conÅ¿equentia:</hi> that the deduction, inference, or conÅ¿equence that is drawn from [a may be] to [a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Å¿o] is weak, and very invalid. There may be a miÅ¿take (Å¿aith he) and muÅ¿t there therefore be a miÅ¿take Å¿ay I? What good conÅ¿equence can be in this? 2. This Doctrine of miÅ¿takes in Scripture, eÅ¿pecially in points of Å¿uch grand concernment, is dangerous to be broached; it tends greatly to engender AtheiÅ¿me in the hearts of men, and Å¿erves to no better a purpoÅ¿e then to unÅ¿ettle men in the Faith; for what will be the conÅ¿equent of it, if there be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿takes in Å¿ome things contained in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, why not in other things? and then what will remain firm that may be Å¿urely built upon? And may not any Heretick when he
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:48559:176"/> is driven out, and forced to forÅ¿ake all other holds, fly hither, and Å¿helter himÅ¿elf here, there may be a miÅ¿take in the Text or Texts that are cited? 3. If there were no other place of Scripture wherein ChriÅ¿t were called God, and if there were no place that holds analogy with this of the <hi>Acts,</hi> where the bloud of ChriÅ¿t is called the bloud of God, there might then be better plea for a miÅ¿take, which yet would be of evil conÅ¿equence if it were granted; but there is a cloud of witneÅ¿Å¿es that come in to evidence ChriÅ¿ts God-head, and there are parallel places to this Text that Å¿peaks of the bloud of God: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>Had they known him, they would never have crucified the Lord of Glory.</hi> ChriÅ¿t was crucified as he was man, and Å¿hed his bloud as he was man, and he was not crucified as he was the Lord of Glory, nor did he Å¿hed his bloud as he was God; and yet it is Å¿aid, the Lord of Glory was crucified, and the bloud of God was Å¿hed: The meaning is, the PerÅ¿on who was Lord of Glory, and who was God, was crucified, and Å¿hed his bloud; but not as he was Lord of Glory, nor as he was God, but fleÅ¿h was aÅ¿Å¿umed, the humanity was taken, and in that nature he was crucified, and Å¿hed his bloud.</p>
               <p>But let it be weighed what he Å¿aith of the poÅ¿Å¿ibility. The Scribe (Å¿aith he) through care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿neÅ¿s, or Å¿omthing worÅ¿e, might here put God
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:48559:176"/> for ChriÅ¿t. There are two places, one in the old TeÅ¿tament, another in the new, which <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let</hi> conceiveth to have been miÅ¿taken by the Scribes negligence, or Å¿omthing worÅ¿e.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> What Scribe doth he here Å¿peak of who might be thus negligent, or Å¿omthing worÅ¿e? Doth he mean Å¿uch Scribes as the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men of God, who were inÅ¿pired by the holy GhoÅ¿t, made uÅ¿e of to write what was Å¿uggeÅ¿ted and dictated to them by the Spirit? Then thoÅ¿e holy Men, Prophets, or ApoÅ¿tles, whether ever they were, who no queÅ¿tion had the Å¿uperviÅ¿ing and peruÅ¿ing of it after written, would have diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered it, and corrected it. Doth he Å¿peak of any other Scribes who might afterwards write out Copies of Å¿uch things? The Original wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting would have been extant to have detected and confuted Å¿uch miÅ¿takes, and fraud, and falÅ¿hood, and there would have been godly ones enough in thoÅ¿e Ages, to have rectified out of the Original Å¿uch error or deceit.

               <p>And <hi>Rivet</hi> adds this, that in all the Hebrew Copies or Exemplars, there is both CAARI and CARU, the one in margent, and the other in the Text: Not that CAARI whether in the margent or in the Text is to be read <hi>[as a Lyon]</hi> but it is <hi>vox animala,</hi> a word beÅ¿ide rule, and is the third perÅ¿on of the preterperfect tenÅ¿e CARA, by Å¿ome interpoÅ¿ition and change of letters, as is Å¿omtimes found in the Hebrew; And he giveth inÅ¿tances of the like.</p>

The Å¿enÅ¿e that he puts upon the text, is without Å¿enÅ¿e, there is not the leaÅ¿t footing for it in the Text; it is a meer invention, without the Å¿hadow of reaÅ¿on in it, for that which it is grounded on, is not to be found in the Text; there is no mention of the bloud of God in the Text, and therefore no reaÅ¿on he Å¿hould paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel it with Å¿uch like phraÅ¿es as the Trees of God, the Cedars of God, which are of the Å¿ame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with other trees, but are more excellent, and are therefore called the Trees and Cedars of God.

                  </gap>, which <hi>Beza</hi> renders <hi>Å¿uo illo proprio Å¿an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine,</hi> that is, by that his own proper bloud; and it relates to the Å¿ubject Å¿poken of before, which is God; for the exhortation is, <hi>to Å¿eed the Church of God,</hi> and it is added, <hi>which he,</hi> that is, which God <hi>hath purchaÅ¿ed with his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per bloud;</hi> Å¿o that it is the bloud of God through the relation it hath to a perÅ¿on, that is called God, whoÅ¿e bloud it is, and not by way of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, as trees are called the trees of God, for the excellency they have in them above other
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:48559:181"/> trees, which yet Å¿tand in no relation to God, Now if he be able to prove that God is not here Å¿poken of, but it is another that is not God, though he be called God; then may he prove that the bloud that is Å¿aid to be his bloud, is yet not the bloud of the perÅ¿on that is God, but the bloud of anothet that is called God, but is not God; otherwiÅ¿e it Å¿tands in force: the bloud of ChriÅ¿t is not the bloud of a meer creature, but the bloud of God; whence the merit of it proceeds for the expiating of Å¿in.</p>
               <p>Whereas he Å¿aith that in this Å¿enÅ¿e <hi>ChriÅ¿t is called the Lamb of God, becauÅ¿e he was far more excellent then the PaÅ¿chal Lamb, oa any other Lamb that was Å¿acrificed.</hi> It is granted that he was Å¿o called for that reaÅ¿on, and not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e ChriÅ¿t who was Å¿lain was man, and thoÅ¿e Lambs were bur bruit creatures, and Å¿o inferior to him, but becauÅ¿e the perÅ¿on of this Lamb Å¿lain, was more then a man, was the Son of God, and very God; but not Å¿lain like a Lamb as he was the Son of God, and very God, but according to the humanity which he aÅ¿Å¿umed; and as the Å¿on of man, and very man, Å¿o was he Å¿lain. It is Å¿aid <hi>the Å¿on of man muÅ¿t be delivered up into the hands of men, and they Å¿hall kill him:</hi> yet though he could not Å¿uffer as God, he not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withÅ¿tanding by the eternal Spirit, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Divinity or God-head, offered up himÅ¿elf a Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice a Lamb without Å¿pot and blemiÅ¿h to
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:48559:181"/> God; which made his bloud more effectual to expiate Å¿in, then the blood of Goats could be; for otherwiÅ¿e there would have been no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in point of worth and value, in purging away of Å¿ins of men; for the bloud of a man at the moÅ¿t, could but Å¿atisfie for the offence of a man, and not of many men; and to this purpoÅ¿e the bloud of a man would have been as ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual as the bloud of a beaÅ¿t.</p>
               <p>I have been large in the vindication of this inÅ¿tance, becauÅ¿e the matter of it was weighty, it being a great Truth of God, and of high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to the Saints: I Å¿hall be the briefer in the next.</p>

                  <hi>What? MuÅ¿t we again take your word for a proof? I wiÅ¿h a better, for there is no goodneÅ¿s in that; we have been too long troubled with the word (I Å¿ay) inÅ¿teed of proof, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> This anÅ¿wer is much altered, it hath fallen under correction Å¿ince it was firÅ¿t pteÅ¿ented to me in the manuÅ¿cript; there was profane Å¿currility in it; wherein he Å¿hewed the tincture of his Å¿pirit: but I complained to one of his dear friends, who was too highly conceited of him, who gave him an Item of it, and Å¿o the words came to be changed, though there be harÅ¿hneÅ¿s enough without any juÅ¿t cauÅ¿e for it. His expreÅ¿Å¿ions did run thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We have already been troubled enough with the Prophet I Å¿ay:</hi> Wherein he firÅ¿t breaks his reÅ¿t upon me. 2. He doth it in a profane way, abuÅ¿ing that Evangelical Prophet <hi>IÅ¿aiah,</hi> which abbreviated is written <hi>IÅ¿ay,</hi> whoÅ¿e perÅ¿on and name deÅ¿erve reverence, becauÅ¿e the honour of becoming the Pen-man of the holy GhoÅ¿t was put upon him. Nor was there occaÅ¿ion given him to Å¿port thus with the Prophets name, for I know not that any Å¿uch words can be found in my writing, as [I Å¿ay] no nor yet the Å¿enÅ¿e of them; for I have not nakedly delivered any thing but there hath been either Scripture or
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:48559:182"/> Argument to inforce it; and in this very inÅ¿tance, <hi>viz. If ChriÅ¿t be a meer creature, then the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ion of ChriÅ¿t is overthrown;</hi> there is a reaÅ¿on to inforce it, which was thus; <hi>BecauÅ¿e a meer man being in heaven, could not know the Å¿tate of the Churches in all places upon earth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not intercede according to the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and neceÅ¿Å¿ity of the Churches:</hi> And though this reaÅ¿on was not confirmed with another, (which it Å¿eems he expected it Å¿hould have bin) yet it was not becauÅ¿e there was no good reaÅ¿on to be rendred, but becauÅ¿e I was in great Å¿traits of time when I thought of, and wrote out that paper of Scripture and Arguments, and had not liberty to enlarge upon any thing, having not three hours to conÅ¿ider of the thing; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e I intended them to fall under the conÅ¿ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of more candid perÅ¿ons; and becauÅ¿e I thought what I preÅ¿ented, might eaÅ¿ily be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from Scripture, if there Å¿hould be any conteÅ¿t.</p>
               <p>Nor hath he invalidated the proof I brought for the Å¿trengthning of this Argument, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding his complaint of want of proof. Let it be conÅ¿idered what he Å¿aith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>have you learned to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure the knowledge of him who hath received the Å¿pirit without meaÅ¿ure? Cannot he as man know in heaven what things are done on earth? Who told you Å¿o?</hi>

               <p> 
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> TheÅ¿e are Å¿trange expreÅ¿Å¿ions to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from one that denyes the Deity of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit equally, as he doth the Deity of ChriÅ¿t; and who makes both the Son, and the holy GhoÅ¿t finite creatures; and who makes the Son the firÅ¿t and principall of all the creatures, and the Lord of all the reÅ¿t, yea God (in Å¿ome Å¿ence) to them all; and Å¿o the Å¿pirit himÅ¿elf is Å¿ervant unto ChriÅ¿t, and ChriÅ¿t is his Lord, and in a kind his God.</p>
               <p>The conradictions in this expoÅ¿tulation of his, <hi>What? have you learned to meaÅ¿ure the knowledge of him who hath received the Å¿pirit without meaÅ¿ure?</hi> in reference to the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Tenents of his, are not a few.</p>
               <p>His expreÅ¿Å¿ions Å¿eem to me to carry Å¿uch a Å¿enÅ¿e; 1. That ChriÅ¿ts knowledge is Å¿o great that it is unmeaÅ¿urable, and conÅ¿equently infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite; and yet he himÅ¿elf but a creature; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿equently finite, which is a contradiction. 2. That this knowledge of ChriÅ¿t came to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaÅ¿urable, becauÅ¿e the Å¿pirit was given to him without meaÅ¿ure, and yet the Å¿pirit himÅ¿elf is finite, and conÅ¿equently meaÅ¿urable according to him. And if the Å¿pirit were infinite, and his wiÅ¿dom infinite, (as indeed he is though he denye it) yet if ChriÅ¿t be a meer creature and wholely finite, as he holds, the maxime is infallible, that, <hi>quicquid recipitur, recipitur ad modum recipientis; What ever thing is received</hi>
                  <pb n="367" facs="tcp:48559:183"/> 
                  <hi>is received according to the Capacity of that which doth receive it;</hi> and conÅ¿equently, when ChriÅ¿t who receives the Spirit is finite, he is not capable to receive any proportion of the Å¿pirit but what is finite, and be may meaÅ¿ured; though the Å¿pirit were infinite. And Å¿o there is a double con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. 3. That this excellent knowledge of ChriÅ¿t, which he Å¿aith cannot be meaÅ¿ured, was received by his receiving of the Å¿pirit; and yet ChriÅ¿t is greater, and more excellent then this Å¿pirit, and the Creator of him, and Lord and God unto him, which is an other contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>Obj.</p>
               <p>But he may plead for himÅ¿elf, and lay, that his words are wreÅ¿ted; and that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of me, whether I have learned to meaÅ¿ure the knowledge of him, <hi>&amp;c?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Though I am not able to meaÅ¿ure the knowledge of ChriÅ¿t (who received the Spirit) poÅ¿itively, Å¿o as to declare exactly what meaÅ¿ure he received, and no more; yet I am able to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure the knowledge of ChriÅ¿t (which he had by the donation of the Spirit) negatively; I can Å¿ay it was not unmeaÅ¿urable, it was not infinite.</p>
               <p>But he bottoms this interrogation upon a Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> John 3. 34. where he Å¿aith, that <hi>God giveth not his Spirit by meaÅ¿ure to him;</hi> And he interprets it to be without meaÅ¿ure, and by conÅ¿equence infinitely.</p>
               <p>But he is miÅ¿taken, for there is a compariÅ¿on
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:48559:184"/> betwixt ChriÅ¿t and <hi>John</hi> the BaptiÅ¿t, and other MiniÅ¿ters of the Church, for they received the Spirit, and are limitted and Å¿tinted, and receive not all that they are capable of, and muÅ¿t have, but the Spirit is divided to them as it pleaÅ¿eth God; to one man is given WiÅ¿dom, and to an other Knowledge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 11. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 7. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 3. but to ChriÅ¿t is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Spirit, not by meaÅ¿ure, that is, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this meaÅ¿ure; for ChriÅ¿t hath all theÅ¿e, and he hath the Spirit in perfection, and not imperfectly, as men here have; and he hath the whole as he is capable of, as man, but yet the whole is not infinite nor unmeaÅ¿urable: of which I have largely before Å¿poken, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Å¿hall not inlarge here.</p>
               <p>It may be further Å¿aid by way of negation, that all the knowledge that ChriÅ¿t hath received as man by the donation of the Spirit, doth not inable him as man, and being in heaven, to know the Å¿tate of all Saints in all places on earth, unleÅ¿s it be by revelation from God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and a new every moment: The reaÅ¿on is, becauÅ¿e as ChriÅ¿ts body is confined to heaven, Å¿o his Å¿oul is confined to his body, and Å¿o the whole humane nature of ChriÅ¿t is confined to one place, and is not, neither can be preÅ¿ent with one Å¿aint on earth, much leÅ¿s with all Å¿aints on earth; and without this preÅ¿ence, there can be no knowledge; for Gods infinite knowledge
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:48559:184"/> is by his infinite preÅ¿ence; but this hath alÅ¿o been Å¿poken of before. And becauÅ¿e none can know the Å¿tate of Å¿aints but he that can know the heart of Å¿aints, but no creature doth this but he that made the heart, and gave to man knowledge, as the Scripture Å¿peaks, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 94. 8, 9, 10. and this is God alone.</p>
               <p>But he goeth on, and Å¿aith;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>None but the man ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us can intercede, it being abÅ¿urd to conceive that God can inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede, unleÅ¿s it might be conceived that God hath a Å¿uperiour: Now if the man ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us doth intercede for his Church, he knows her Å¿tate; and why he may not know it by a communication of power from the Father, notwithÅ¿tanding he be not God and man in one perÅ¿on, is a riddle; for the unfolding whereof I would willingly plow with your heifer:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> The act of InterceÅ¿Å¿ion doth belong to JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t as man, and the reaÅ¿on is Å¿trong which he renders; but the ability to intercede, Å¿eeing it muÅ¿t be for all Å¿aints, according to their particular conditions and neceÅ¿Å¿ities, doth apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to ChriÅ¿t as God, and the validity of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceÅ¿Å¿ion is bottomed there alÅ¿o.</p>
               <p>And whereas he Å¿peaks of a communication of power from the Father, to know the Å¿tate of the Church; if he mean by it any inherent power or vertue reÅ¿iding in ChriÅ¿t, but given by the Father, by which ChriÅ¿t is inabled by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:48559:185"/> from time to time, to know all the hidden things, and deepeÅ¿t Å¿ecrets, and the moÅ¿t inward thoughts and ways, and the moÅ¿t retired tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Å¿piritual neceÅ¿Å¿ities of the Church it is impoÅ¿Å¿ible, for the reaÅ¿ons before mentioned; and becauÅ¿e there is not a greater thing by which the excellency and glory of that infinite wiÅ¿dom of God himÅ¿elf can be diÅ¿covered and made known then this, to penetrate the hearts, and diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the motions of the Å¿pirits of men; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e the Lord himÅ¿elf by the Prophet <hi>Amos,</hi> reckons this, <hi>viz. the declaring unto man his thought,</hi> among the great, and proper, and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar works of God, which the creature cannot effect, whch require an infinite power, which no creature can be the Å¿ubject of; in <hi>Amos</hi> 4. 13. <hi>For lo he that formeth the mountains, and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the wind, and declareth unto man his thought, &amp;c.</hi> and then he concludes, <hi>the Lord, the God of hoaÅ¿t is his Name.</hi> And becauÅ¿e both God himÅ¿elf, and the Prophets, and holy men of God have attributed it to God alone, as hath bin proved before, and you may diÅ¿cern from <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 11. that it is imprinted upon the very Å¿pirits and minds of the Heathen, to acknowledge a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarity in this thing to appertain to God. And becauÅ¿e its poÅ¿Å¿ible a like for the Father to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to the creature a power of being every where, as of knowing all things in all places, yea the moÅ¿t inÅ¿earchable things of all perÅ¿ons with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:48559:185"/> any perÅ¿onal preÅ¿ence, where Å¿uch perÅ¿ons and things are: And indeed it may as rationally and as truly be aÅ¿Å¿erted, that God may commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate his own nature and eÅ¿Å¿ence, and all his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes to the creature, as communicate this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute of omniÅ¿cience, or inveÅ¿t man with a power of knowing of the Å¿tate of all Å¿aints, which is all one; for what is it that God cannot give a power to know, if he can give power to know the inclinations, hidden motions, Å¿ecret work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and abÅ¿truÅ¿e actings of the Å¿oul and Å¿pirit? and if God can make the creature to know as much as himÅ¿elf knows, by communication, then he can make the creature a God by communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. And if we look into the way by which God himÅ¿elf comes to know theÅ¿e things, we Å¿hall be able to diÅ¿cern that this knowledge cannot be communicated, becauÅ¿e all things and perÅ¿ons are of God, and from God, and they live, move, and have their being in him, therefore it is impoÅ¿Å¿ible but that he Å¿hould be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all their actings, motions, and ways; but this is communicable which is the cauÅ¿e of this knowledge of God. God cannot make per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons or things to have their Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿tings and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the creature, and therefore he cannot communicate Å¿uch a power, and make it reÅ¿ide in the creature, by which they may have Å¿uch a knowledge. The effect is no more communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then the cauÅ¿e is communicable.</p>
               <pb n="372" facs="tcp:48559:186"/>
               <p> But if he meaneth by a communication of power from the Father to know the Å¿tate of the Church, nothing elÅ¿e but Gods revealing to ChriÅ¿t in heaven from time to time, the Å¿tate and condition of the Church, and of all Å¿aints, as he did to <hi>Daniel Nebuchadnezars</hi> Dream which was gone from him; this will be granted as poÅ¿Å¿ible in reference to the creature, but this is not properly a communication of power to the creature from the Father; but the manifeÅ¿tation of Gods WiÅ¿dom and Power by the creature, and the creature is not the Å¿ubject of it in which this wiÅ¿dom reÅ¿ides, but God himÅ¿elf. But this is not Å¿utable to ChriÅ¿t, to Å¿ay that what know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ChriÅ¿t hath in heaven of the affairs of the Church, and Å¿tate of the Å¿aints, is by Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation; for this would make ChriÅ¿t a PrieÅ¿t of like imperfection which was in the high PrieÅ¿ts, for they were capable of revelation alÅ¿o as well as ChriÅ¿t, if God had pleaÅ¿ed to have manifeÅ¿ted himÅ¿elf unto them in the diÅ¿covery of the Churches wants; but it behoved ChriÅ¿t to be more excellent, to be a PrieÅ¿t not in weakneÅ¿s, but in Å¿trength, and to be able to Å¿ave to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moÅ¿t, and conÅ¿equently to have the ability of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceding in himÅ¿elf. For to be able to Å¿ave by anothers Å¿trength, is Å¿uch an ability as <hi>Paul</hi> Å¿peaks of, when he Å¿aith, <hi>I am able to do all things through Christ Å¿trengthning of me:</hi> Å¿uch ability is inability, it is to be unable rather then able in
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:48559:186"/> and of himÅ¿elf; as a child that is moved by the Å¿trength of the arms of the Mother, or as a Å¿ick man that is upheld in his walking; which makes nothing to the glory of ChriÅ¿t at all, but is a diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor to him: and hence it is that it was needful that ChriÅ¿t Å¿hould be God and man in one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on, that he might be the Å¿ubject of this power, and that he might by himÅ¿elf Å¿ave us. BeÅ¿ides, it is unÅ¿criptural to Å¿ay that the Father reveals the Å¿tate of the Church to ChriÅ¿t, and that ChriÅ¿t knows it not till then. Yea, it is repugnant to the Scripture, for it is Å¿aid ChriÅ¿t is <hi>he that Å¿earch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the heart, &amp;c.</hi> he knows, becauÅ¿e he Å¿earch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and not becauÅ¿e it is revealed to him.</p>
               <p>But he paÅ¿Å¿eth from this ninth Argument, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence to viÅ¿it my tenth, and yet Å¿aith ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a word to it, but refers me to his anÅ¿wer to <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 20. <hi>I am with you alwaies to the end of the world.</hi> But whether this be Å¿ollidly or Å¿lightly done, I Å¿hall leave to the Reader to judge after I have preÅ¿ented it to his view.</p>

If it be, then ChriÅ¿t a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is not a Å¿ufficient Saviour, but ChriÅ¿t and the Spirit together; or rather, ChriÅ¿t is inÅ¿uffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, but the Spirit is Å¿ufficient, and yet but a creature, and inferiour to ChriÅ¿t, and his InÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

Much leÅ¿s is Å¿atisfaction given by this anÅ¿wer of his to <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 11. where it is Å¿aid, that <hi>the Lord Å¿tood by</hi> Paul, <hi>and Å¿aid, be of good cheer</hi> Paul, <hi>for as thou hast teÅ¿tified of me at JeruÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, Å¿o must thou bear witneÅ¿s of me at Rome.</hi> SuppoÅ¿e this were done in a ViÅ¿ion, yet the ViÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is of ChriÅ¿t, not of the Spirit, I have not Å¿aid that the Spirit Å¿tood by the Lord, and it is the preÅ¿ence of ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elf, and the conÅ¿olation of ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elf that <hi>Paul</hi> in this ViÅ¿ion is inÅ¿truct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, though neither the Father nor the holy GhoÅ¿t is to be excluded; for Father, Son, and holy GhoÅ¿t are all of them preÅ¿ent with all Å¿aints alwaies, and do all of them work the Å¿ame work, the order Å¿till obÅ¿erved: So that when it
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:48559:188"/> is Å¿aid that the Father and the Son do inÅ¿truct or protect by the Spirit, it muÅ¿t not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tood that they are <hi>cauÅ¿a adjuvantes,</hi> cauÅ¿es helping one another; for all of them are all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ufficient, and all of them do effect the whole work in Å¿uch an order of working: much leÅ¿s that the Spirit is only operative, and the Father and Son are inactive in the work, and are onely authorative in it, and do imploy the Spirit, as their inÅ¿trument; as the lord of the houÅ¿e doth act things by his Å¿ervants, whom he imploys as meÅ¿Å¿engers to effect Å¿uch things, or whom he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points or deÅ¿igns for Å¿uch undertakings; for Å¿o would he have us to conceive of ChriÅ¿t, that he doth nothing himÅ¿elf, but is contained in heaven, and is neither preÅ¿ent, nor acts any thing on earth, but Å¿ends the Spirit to effect all for him, and this Spirit is preÅ¿ent, and doth all that is done, and ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elf doth nothing: For this is confuted in this ViÅ¿ion, where the Lord Å¿hew, himÅ¿elf preÅ¿ent, and he himÅ¿elf gives out the word <hi>of good cheer,</hi> and effects it alÅ¿o by his own power.</p>

<pb n="378" facs="tcp:48559:189"/> 
                  <hi>Stephen</hi> more eÅ¿pecially, who prayed to God the Son; for every Text of Scripture that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns prayer to God, enjoyns it to the whole Trinity, to Father, Son, and Spirit, and not to the Father only; becauÅ¿e there is no God but he, who is one in EÅ¿Å¿ence, and three in perÅ¿ons, as hath been proved before. And let him Å¿hew that rule that enjoyns prayer to God, <hi>viz.</hi> the Father, excluding the Son and the holy GhoÅ¿t, if he can; and if he cannot, let him bluÅ¿h for Å¿hame becauÅ¿e he hath aÅ¿Å¿erted it; and he hath offended here againÅ¿t the generation of the Å¿aints, who have been wont to pray to God in the perÅ¿on of the Son, not excluding the Father and the Spirit. <hi>Stephen</hi> is an example of Å¿uch a practiÅ¿e, and many more beÅ¿ides him; in <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 59. <hi>They Å¿toned</hi> Stephen, <hi>calling upon God and Å¿aying, Lord JeÅ¿us receive my Å¿pirit.</hi> It was the Å¿econd perÅ¿on, the Son who took fleÅ¿h, and is God in fleÅ¿h, that was called upon, and prayed unto, and muÅ¿t he be made a TranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿or?</p>

                  <hi>the Lord;</hi> what Lord was this? It was the Lord ChriÅ¿t: How may that appear? From the anÅ¿wer that he received, and the uÅ¿e he made of it; the anÅ¿wer was, <hi>My grace is Å¿ufficient for thee, My power is made perfect in weakneÅ¿s:</hi> the uÅ¿e that he makes of it is this, <hi>moÅ¿t gladly therefore will I glory in my infirmities, that the power of ChriÅ¿t may reÅ¿t upon me.</hi> The power that is made perfect in weakneÅ¿s, is the power of ChriÅ¿t.

               <p>But he excepts againÅ¿t theÅ¿e two examples of <hi>Stephen</hi> and <hi>John;</hi> firÅ¿t he makes a queÅ¿tion of it, whether <hi>Stephen</hi> did pray directly to ChriÅ¿t or not; for he expreÅ¿Å¿eth himÅ¿elf with an <hi>(if)</hi> as if he doubted; but to doubt in plain things is fooliÅ¿hneÅ¿s, and to Å¿tumble where there is no Å¿tone to Å¿tumble at, is perverÅ¿neÅ¿s. It will be granted (I hope) that he prayed to him to whom he Å¿pake; but he Å¿pake to ChriÅ¿t; and the words in the Greek make it clear, <hi>They Å¿to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> Stephen, <hi>calling upon and Å¿aying, Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us receive my Å¿pirit;</hi> there is none other men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned but the Lord JeÅ¿us upon whom he called, and to whom he Å¿aid, <hi>receive my Å¿pirit;</hi> and he
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:48559:190"/> warrants it by <hi>ChriÅ¿ts viÅ¿ible appearance, as Lots prayer unto the Angels</hi> being viÅ¿ible; but what viÅ¿ible appearance was there when <hi>Paul</hi> prayed to ChriÅ¿t in the forementioned places? or when all the Saints prayed to ChriÅ¿t, as the ApoÅ¿tle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates the practiÅ¿e to be in the primitive times? what Å¿ight had they firÅ¿t of ChriÅ¿t before they prayed? did ChriÅ¿t appear viÅ¿ibly to every one of them firÅ¿t? what a groundleÅ¿s conceit is this, and how far from truth? beÅ¿ides, what did Å¿uch a viÅ¿ible Å¿ight advantage him, when he Å¿aw him in heaven; for unleÅ¿s it were in a viÅ¿ion that he Å¿aw him, it was in heaven that he Å¿aw him; and if Å¿o, the diÅ¿tance was as great as if he had not Å¿een him, therefore it could not be bottomed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ground; for ChriÅ¿t was never a whit the more preÅ¿ent becauÅ¿e <hi>Stephen</hi> Å¿aw him: And Å¿o the example of <hi>Lots</hi> praying to the Angel is no whit Å¿utable, becauÅ¿e the Angel was not onely viÅ¿ible, but preÅ¿ent.</p>
               <p>But what doth he mean by bringing in Å¿uch an inÅ¿tance of <hi>Lots</hi> praying to an Angel? will he Å¿et on foot the doctrine of invocation upon Å¿aints and Angels by it? If he would do it, that inÅ¿tance which he brings of <hi>Lot,</hi> will not help, him at all, it was neither of the two Angels that <hi>Lot</hi> prayed to, that he received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his houÅ¿e and lodged, but the third Angel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom <hi>Abraham</hi> Å¿tood, who was now come to the other two, and this was <hi>Jehovah</hi>

This appears further from <hi>ver.</hi> 22. 23, 24. <hi>I can do nothing</hi> Å¿aith this Angel to whom <hi>Lot</hi> prayed, <hi>till thou come thither</hi> and afterward it is Å¿aid, <hi>the Lord rained &amp;c.</hi> in the Hebrew <hi>Jehovah rained &amp;c. from Jehovah,</hi> the Son from the Father: It was he that rained fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tone that Å¿aid before to <hi>Lot,</hi> in anÅ¿wer to his prayer, <hi>I have accepted thee in this thing; haÅ¿te thee thither, for I can do nothing till thou come thither:</hi> and this is called <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and it is Å¿aid <hi>he rained from Jehovah.</hi> So that he is groÅ¿ly miÅ¿taken in this alÅ¿o, about <hi>Lots</hi> praying to a creature Angel, by which he would prove it warrantable to pray to a creature ChriÅ¿t, but puts it upon the viÅ¿ibleneÅ¿s of him, when yet this Angel was not only viÅ¿ible, but preÅ¿ent; and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah</hi> in the perÅ¿on of a man.</p>

Whether can any man on earth, and whether could <hi>Adam</hi> in his ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency hear as far as he can Å¿ee? or whether Å¿uch a thing be poÅ¿Å¿ible in nature? whether the care be not Å¿lower in diÅ¿cerning its obiect, then the ey is in diÅ¿cerning its obiect? 2. Whether <hi>Stephen</hi> Å¿aw ChriÅ¿t by the Å¿trength of his own natural ey Å¿ight? if Å¿o, why did not all the reÅ¿t Å¿ee ChriÅ¿t as well as he? if not, then he was Å¿trength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Å¿ee that which he Å¿aw, and Å¿o it was no leÅ¿s then wonderfull, that he Å¿aw ChriÅ¿t; God, by the greatneÅ¿s of his power made <hi>Stephen</hi> to Å¿ee ChriÅ¿t; and Å¿o it may be granted that God by the exceeding greatneÅ¿s of his power, might inable the man ChriÅ¿t, or ChriÅ¿t according to his manhood to hear <hi>Stephen,</hi> but then it is a thing above nature, and Å¿o it comes to this, that ChriÅ¿t as man is not able but is only capable of being made able, and prayer to ChriÅ¿t is not to be bottomed upon that. 3. Whether it was the voice that <hi>Stephen</hi> uttered that was the cauÅ¿e
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:48559:192"/> of ChriÅ¿ts hearing <hi>Stephen?</hi> or whether if there had been no voice, ChriÅ¿t could not have heard the voice of the heart, the motions of it, the cry of it? if ChriÅ¿t could notwithÅ¿tanding have heard, as is apparent from other Scriptures, then it was not the eare of the body, or the fleÅ¿hly eare with which ChriÅ¿t heard <hi>Stephen,</hi> but it was by that vaÅ¿t boundleÅ¿s knowledge, which ChriÅ¿t had, as the Son of God, and as God, and by which the diÅ¿ciples told him that <hi>he knew all things:</hi> and then the compariÅ¿on which he makes betwixt ChriÅ¿t and <hi>Stephen,</hi> the one's Å¿eeing, and the other's hearing, might have been Å¿pared, for the things are not alike in which the compariÅ¿on was made. And this Å¿hewes the abÅ¿urdity of his imagination, <hi>viz.</hi> that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that ChriÅ¿t hath, being in heaven, of the prayers that are made on earth to him, by the hearing of the eare.</p>

               <p>I thought good to preÅ¿ent this errour of his to the Readers view, becauÅ¿e my paper being never intended for him, was in a plaine facile way penned, that it might be the better conceived of by Å¿uch to whom I preÅ¿ented it, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tood not rules of diÅ¿puting; but he puts all into a Å¿cholaÅ¿tique forme, and would not incounter with me in that plain way of arguing, with this deÅ¿igne (as he pretended) to make my weakneÅ¿s the more obvious, but Å¿ure I am whether my weakneÅ¿s be obvious or not, his over Å¿ight (that I Å¿ay no worÅ¿e) is obvious in tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ing the rules of arguing which yet himÅ¿elf chuÅ¿eth, as pretending to have skill in them.</p>

By diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Å¿upreme judge of the worrd, and a delegate Judge; and grants the propoÅ¿ition to be true, only in reference to the principal or Å¿upreme Judge, but aÅ¿Å¿erts it to be falÅ¿e of the delegate Judge. And this he doth with a great deal of confuÅ¿ion, for I rather repreÅ¿ent what he would Å¿ay, then what he doth Å¿ay.</p>
               <p>FirÅ¿t he tels us of the ApoÅ¿tles. <hi>That they Å¿hall Å¿it upon twelve Thrones, judging tbe twelve Tribes of IÅ¿rael,</hi> Mat. 19. 28. and then he tells us of the Å¿aints, that <hi>they Å¿hall judge the world,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 2, 3. and then tells me, <hi>that doubtleÅ¿s I had not this text of Corinths when I brought this Argument in my thoughts.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> Whether I had this text of the Corinths in my mind in that very moment when I penned down this Argument, I am not able to Å¿ay; but I would not have him to be conceited as if he had brought Å¿ome new and Å¿trange thing to my knowledge, which before I underÅ¿tood not, as his words do import, which are theÅ¿e; <hi>What will you Å¿ay if I Å¿hall Å¿hew you from the Word that</hi>

                  <hi>the ApoÅ¿tles Å¿hall be Judges at the laÅ¿t day, and that the Saints Å¿hall judg the World?</hi> Alas, alas, that man that Å¿hall be non-pluÅ¿s'd with the Å¿hewing of Å¿uch a thing as this, is but poorly learned in ChriÅ¿tianity.</p>
               <p>It is eaÅ¿ily anÅ¿wered, that though the ApoÅ¿tles and Saints Å¿hall judg the world, &amp;c. yet they are no where called the Judges of the World: And their judging is CatacherÅ¿tically, and very improperly Å¿o called. The ApoÅ¿tles more eÅ¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially are Å¿aid to judg the twelve Tribes, or the World, becauÅ¿e as <hi>Paul</hi> Å¿peaks, <hi>all Å¿hall be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to their GoÅ¿pel, Rom.</hi> 2. 16. and both ApoÅ¿tles and Angels do judg the World, as AÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ores, as <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> Å¿aith, <hi>ChriÅ¿tus ApoÅ¿tolos &amp; Sanctos omnes cooptavit aÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ores;</hi> They Å¿it after the manner of JuÅ¿tices of the Peace upon the Bench, and hear all, and allow of all, and approve of all, and allow of all, and conÅ¿ent to all, and are WitneÅ¿Å¿es of ChriÅ¿ts righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous proceedings, and in no other Å¿ence can they be Å¿aid to judg; and what hath he gained by this? and what doth his new diÅ¿covery, which he thought I never thought of, amount to?</p>
               <p>His diÅ¿tinction is to better purpoÅ¿e which he brings afterward, of <hi>principal Judg,</hi> and <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate or Deputy Judg;</hi> and yet it will not mar my Market, as he imagines; his words are.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In a Å¿ence it is true, no creature can be Judg</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And afterward he lays down two Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿itions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the moÅ¿t high God, who is the Worlds principal Judg, will not immediately, but by a Delegate, judg the World,</hi> Acts 17. 31. John 5. 22. 1 Cor. 15. 28.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t is Å¿ubordinate Judg, in reference unto God the Å¿upream Judg, but Å¿uper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendent in reference to the Saints,</hi> Act. 10. 42. &amp; 3. 20. Mat. 16. 27. Joh. 5. 27.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> One diÅ¿tinction which hath been often given, and is ordinary and familiar with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tians, of no vaÅ¿t knowledg, will Å¿atisfie the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿itions, and anÅ¿wer all the Scriptures, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile all Å¿eeming differences. The moÅ¿t high God, who as Father, Son, and Holy GhoÅ¿t, in each perÅ¿on, is the Worlds principal Judg, and every perÅ¿on not excluding the other is Å¿o. And ChriÅ¿t, as he is the Å¿econd PerÅ¿on in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, as he is the Son, and as he is equal with the Father, is the Worlds principal Judg, conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a part from the fleÅ¿h, which he hath now aÅ¿Å¿umed, the Father and the Holy GhoÅ¿t not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.

                  <hi>Iehovah,</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> calls him <hi>the Iudg of all the Earth:</hi> And in <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 24. he acted as a Judg; he Jehovah the Son, rained fire and brimÅ¿tone upon <hi>Sodom</hi> from Jehovah his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And in <hi>IÅ¿ai.</hi> 45. 22, 23. ChriÅ¿t calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf <hi>God,</hi> and Å¿aith, <hi>there is none elÅ¿e;</hi> and Å¿aith, that <hi>every knee Å¿hall bow to him,</hi> that is, in the day of Judgment, as the ApoÅ¿tle (an ExpoÅ¿itor without exception) holds forth in <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 10, 11. But ChriÅ¿t as conÅ¿idered in fleÅ¿h, being found in faÅ¿hion as a man, as he is Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and man, being both God and man in one PerÅ¿on, is deÅ¿igned and ordained by the Father, Son, and Holy GhoÅ¿t to judg the world in righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s, as from <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 31. he proves. And Å¿o the Father, Son, and Holy GhoÅ¿t judg no man, but have committed all Judgment to the Son in fleÅ¿h, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 22. and in the Son in fleÅ¿h they judg, and this Power and Honour hath he received as Mediator in fleÅ¿h; but when all enemies are Å¿ubdued and judged, then he Å¿hall deliver up this Kingdom and Power, and Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy GhoÅ¿t, the one true God, who Å¿hall be all in all, and the Son himÅ¿elf according to the fleÅ¿h Å¿hall be Å¿ubject. And in this Å¿ence as Mediator in fleÅ¿h, he may be called a delegate Judg; for that the humane Nature of ChriÅ¿t Å¿hould be taken up into the fellowÅ¿hip of this Glory with the eternal Son, this was by
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:48559:195"/> ordination. As the Son in fleÅ¿h had been hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, Å¿o the fleÅ¿h with the Son muÅ¿t be exalted to this Glory, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 9, 10. And the Glory which ChriÅ¿t hath as Mediator, is founded upon ChriÅ¿ts Å¿onÅ¿hip in this reÅ¿pect as Judg, as in all other reÅ¿pects, &amp; indeed in any other reÅ¿pect but as the Son, he is not capable of being Judg; for though whole ChriÅ¿t be Judg, yet the natural right to it, and ability to perform it, is as he is the Son; and that the whole in both Natures is Judg, is of grace, And can any rational man think, that ChriÅ¿t a meer man Å¿hould be able to judg the Å¿ecrets of men, if he were not God as wel as man; Å¿o that that honor to judg as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, is given to him in fleÅ¿h, as declarative of that eÅ¿Å¿ential Power and Glory which he had as Son with the Father and Spirit from Eternity, that all might honour the Son with the equal ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour as the Father is honoured.</p>
               <p>And whereas he Å¿aith, That the Father is principal in Judgment, and is the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> of it, alluding to the place where the Father is Å¿o called, why Å¿hould not the Son be principal in Judgment with the Father, being the Alpha and Omega of it, Å¿eeing he alÅ¿o is Å¿o called in Scripture.</p>
               <p>Thus I have followed him in all his EvaÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Å¿hifts, and have unmasked his AnÅ¿wers, and plucked off the fair Vizard that he had put upon them, and have diÅ¿covered the deceit, and found
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:48559:196"/> fraud, and falÅ¿hood that was hid under them. And I have vindicated the reÅ¿t of the Scriptures that I alledged from his corrupt Interpretations that he put upon them, and have confirmed the Arguments which I produced, and they now abide in their Å¿trength, and have removed and taken out of the way that which troubled their TeÅ¿timony, which they brought to the Godhead of ChriÅ¿t, that they could not be heard, by reaÅ¿on of the noiÅ¿e that his AnÅ¿wers made in mens ears.</p>
               <p>Let it be conÅ¿idered from firÅ¿t to laÅ¿t, what a poor, weak feeble, baÅ¿e, mean, contemptible, diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piÅ¿eable ChriÅ¿t, Saviour, Mediator, InterceÅ¿Å¿or he makes this great God and our Lord JeÅ¿us to be; and what a penurious, defective lame, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s and Å¿atisfaction he brings unto us for our Å¿upport and how Å¿hamefully and reproachfully he Å¿trips him, robs him of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Glory in all things that is due unto him: The worÅ¿hip which he muÅ¿t have, can but amount to Reverence, which is only due to one, that hath the meer honour to come in the name of another, which is all he grants to ChriÅ¿t; for he denies him to be the ultimate object of worÅ¿hip, and there is no intermediate object of worÅ¿hip which is not founded in the ultimate or laÅ¿t ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: and all that come in Gods name, <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> and all the Prophets Å¿hare with him upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in this reverence.

This is an humbling of him with a witneÅ¿s: and he is but an inÅ¿trumental Saviour whoÅ¿e vertue is in an other according to him, as there have bin many Å¿ince the beginning of the world, and Å¿till are; the beaÅ¿ts which were Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed, and the PrieÅ¿ts who Å¿acrificed them, were inÅ¿trumental Å¿aviours; and now the GoÅ¿pel, and the Preachers thereof are inÅ¿trumental Å¿aviours, and Gods appointment and aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance (which he Å¿aith ChriÅ¿t had) might have made them (as he muÅ¿t needs grant) as effectual as he; thus he le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels ChriÅ¿t &amp; brings him down from his height to be like to other things, which are fellow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿truments with him. And Å¿o he makes ChriÅ¿t to be a meer mediator by aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance, but impotent in himÅ¿elf; for Å¿aith he, what work Å¿oever you can inÅ¿tance in belonging to ChriÅ¿ts mediatorÅ¿hip of himÅ¿elf he was not able to perform it, unleÅ¿s by the aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance of another and Å¿o he was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Mediator; and Å¿o might <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man be: and thus he is made weak and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble like one of us, not having the leaÅ¿t Å¿ufficiency of himÅ¿elf, but a capacity to partake of Gods Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, which alÅ¿o may be predicated of any other perÅ¿on, they may not Å¿ay they are able to
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:48559:197"/> do all things that God will call them forth to, through Gods Å¿trengthning them; and he makes ChriÅ¿t to be but an inÅ¿trumental Agent in that righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s by which believers are juÅ¿tified: an inÅ¿trumental Agent alÅ¿o in forgiving Å¿ins; he doth but act about theÅ¿e things, is not the Author of them: and herein other men have the Å¿ame priviledge. He himÅ¿elf tels us that it is the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Å¿ome men to forgive all Å¿ins in reference to the curÅ¿e of the Law, and he quotes <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 23. which is to be underÅ¿tood in a declarative way, and ChriÅ¿t hath no greater honour then this. The Å¿atisfaction alÅ¿o of ChriÅ¿t is rather Å¿atiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of grace, as he preÅ¿ents it, then Å¿atisfaction of juÅ¿tice; it is Å¿atisfaction without any proportion to the offence. As he lays it down he doth in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect bring in God Å¿peaking of it, as the ApoÅ¿tle brings in God Å¿peaking of mercy, <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy;</hi> and Å¿o he, <hi>I wil be Å¿atisfied wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And his ability to intercede ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the condition and neceÅ¿Å¿ity of the Church, is not from himÅ¿elf nor in himÅ¿elf, but from a communication of power from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And for judging he doth it in an inÅ¿trumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal way and hath all Å¿aints copartners with him in the work, Å¿haring in the like honor only he is Å¿uperintendent in it, which belongs rather to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then to power.</p>
               <pb n="395" facs="tcp:48559:197"/>
               <p> After this manner he deals with ChriÅ¿t, who was, and is, and ever will be in the form of God, and equal with God, with him he deals thus; humbling him abaÅ¿ing him, and making him in all things to be like unto men, proportioning him, and equalling him to others, not by vayling his his glory and majeÅ¿ty, but by denying<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> it; which is the higheÅ¿t indignity that can be offered to this Lord of glory. And yet (which is not a little to be wondred at, and Å¿orrowed for) how many are there who will not underÅ¿tand this, but cry him up for a great advancer of ChriÅ¿t, yea he is made Å¿uperlative herein! they Å¿ay he exalts ChriÅ¿t above all that ever they heard preach him; but either they declare their groÅ¿s ignorance, or Å¿omthing that is worÅ¿e. They may Å¿ow fig-leaves together to cover his nakedneÅ¿s, and hide his Å¿hame, but if they be intelligent perÅ¿ons, they muÅ¿t needs know that the Å¿ubÅ¿tance and truth of divine glory and excellency is plucked off, and torn away from him, and that the Å¿haddow only remaineth; he hath taken away all glorying from ChriÅ¿t, as the ApoÅ¿tle took it away from Å¿aints; it may be Å¿aid of ChriÅ¿t, as of others; <hi>What haÅ¿t thou</hi> oh ChriÅ¿t, <hi>which thou haÅ¿t not received?</hi> ChriÅ¿t hath received more of Gods grace, and is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to the moÅ¿t high, and that is all he can glory of according to him, for he hath nothing of his own to glory of.</p>
               <p>And yet many poor ChriÅ¿tians though thus defrauded &amp; cheated of the true ChriÅ¿t, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:48559:198"/> with the ChriÅ¿t which he obtrudeth upon them, and bleÅ¿s themÅ¿elves with the knowledge of Å¿uch a ChriÅ¿t which he hath Å¿haped out, or miÅ¿haped rather, who holds no proportion with that which Scripture hath limned out and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ented to us; yet they rejoyce and glory in this ChriÅ¿t. O miÅ¿erable darkneÅ¿s and blindneÅ¿s (that I Å¿ay not perverÅ¿neÅ¿s) in men, in ChriÅ¿tians, that they do not diÅ¿cover how great and dangerous the cheat is! Oh how dangerous is this? If God Å¿hould not be merciful to them, and open their eys to Å¿ee the horridneÅ¿s of it, what would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of them? Such an impotent weak ChriÅ¿t who could not Å¿ave himÅ¿elf by any Å¿trength in himÅ¿elf, is unlike to Å¿ave them. And thus far in AnÅ¿wer to him and his book.</p>

And partly becauÅ¿e the juÅ¿t li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of propheÅ¿ying (which belongs (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) without contradiction, to the people, if it be rightly bounded) hath been denied them by the generality of the MiniÅ¿ters of this Nation, which have cryed out againÅ¿t it; whence it hath come to paÅ¿Å¿e that many precious ones among the people have entertained thoughts, that the MiniÅ¿ters deÅ¿igne hath been to keep them in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and to advance themÅ¿elves over them, and Å¿o they have broken from them, and have had them in diÅ¿eÅ¿teeme.

               <p n="10">10. There is an exorbitancy in that liberty which Saints have to exerciÅ¿e their gifts in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy. All the Brethren that are in a Church are not Prophets, that is, all have not the gift of Prophecy; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 29 <hi>and chap.</hi> 14. 1. But they muÅ¿t be proved firÅ¿t, and approved, before they take upon them to prophecie, and thoÅ¿e who are Å¿ound and Å¿ober Å¿hould only be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. What is Å¿poken of Deacons, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 10. will hold in proportion to others, and hands muÅ¿t not be laid on Å¿uddenly, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. A Å¿udden approbation of any to office is not allowed, and there is the Å¿ame reaÅ¿on for the exerciÅ¿e of gifts. As every one hath received a gift, Å¿o let him diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penÅ¿e it; there are private gifts, and there are publick gifts; there are gifts that may edifie a
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:48559:203"/> few, and there are gifts that may edifie many; there are gifts that may edifie weak ones, and there are gifts to edifie Å¿trong ones; there are gifts that may edifie a family, and there are gifts that may edifie a Church; there are gifts that may edifie a part of the body, and there are gifts that may edifie the whole body; There may be profit in the exerciÅ¿e of Å¿ome gifts to Å¿ome, when there is no honour to ChriÅ¿t before men, that Å¿uch gifts Å¿hould be publickly exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed. The Ordinances of God by this liberty, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warily and unÅ¿oberly uÅ¿ed, fals under much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. Not but that I wiÅ¿h from my very Å¿oule that all the Lords people were Prophets, and that all had gifts by which all might edifie and be edified, and ChriÅ¿t glorified in all, who hath given Å¿uch gifts to men; but till there be Å¿uch a pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out of the Å¿pirit, let none be carried out beyond what he hath received, Å¿ome have much more need to learn then to teach in an AÅ¿Å¿em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>
               <p>And how can any preach unleÅ¿Å¿e they be Å¿ent, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 11. unleÅ¿Å¿e perÅ¿ons can aÅ¿Å¿ume to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves and make out to others an immediate cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as the ApoÅ¿tles did. If they be not able to Å¿ay that their calling to preach is not of men, nor by men, but by JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, then there muÅ¿t be an order in the Churches of ChriÅ¿t, and they muÅ¿t fall under it. If they think they have a gift, they muÅ¿t not exerciÅ¿e it becauÅ¿e they think
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:48559:203"/> Å¿o, but they muÅ¿t be called forth, and their gift tryed, &amp; the Church muÅ¿t judge. And unleÅ¿Å¿e this ChriÅ¿tian-liberty of exerciÅ¿ing gifts be thus boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, how wil the exorbitancy in the exerciÅ¿e of it be repreÅ¿Å¿ed? Many run upon this work being dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven therto by their luÅ¿ts, I Å¿peak what I know, and what many with me have had woful experience of. A flood-gate to errour is Å¿et open by this means, and I think truth hath been as much undermined by this one Å¿tratagem of Satan, <hi>viz.</hi> The Å¿etting up of multiplicity of teachers, as by any other policy of his, theÅ¿e many ages. The time was that the MiniÅ¿try undermined prophecy in the gifted Saints, but the time is, that propheÅ¿ie in thoÅ¿e that are (many of them neither gifted nor called, undermines MiniÅ¿try. And the peoples Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are many of them inordinately carried, rather after prophecy, by the pooreÅ¿t, weakeÅ¿t, and raweÅ¿t perÅ¿ons, that will conÅ¿ume time that way, then after the beÅ¿t gifts that are miniÅ¿te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially exerciÅ¿ed among them. I am loth to Å¿ay that Å¿uch who are exerciÅ¿ed, and Å¿uch who put them upon it, and incourage them in it, do Å¿eek honour one of another, and not that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Å¿o much which is of God: but if I Å¿ay that there is Å¿ome temptation upon their Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, Å¿ure I am, I Å¿hall not miÅ¿Å¿e it in reference un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many, and I charge not all. I am afraid leÅ¿t the times be come or coming, of which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tle Å¿peaks, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3, 4. That Å¿ound doctrine
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:48559:204"/> will not be endured, and that men after their luÅ¿ts, will heap unto them teachers, having itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ears, and that they Å¿hall turn away their ears from the truth, and Å¿hall be turned after fables. For the laÅ¿t times are Å¿poken of by <hi>Paul,</hi> and theÅ¿e are the laÅ¿t times; and now there are more teachers then all latter ages have Å¿hewed, and Truth hath leÅ¿Å¿e acceptation among many then Errour, at leaÅ¿t the Reprovers of errour will not be endured, but Å¿uch ones in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to many perÅ¿ons, makes themÅ¿elves a prey.

               <p>I have cleared my Å¿elf from being any enemy to prophecying, yet leÅ¿t I Å¿hould be Å¿uÅ¿pected, I declare it again, that I am not againÅ¿t it, but I look upon it as an ordinance of ChriÅ¿t, if it be rightly regulated, and it is on foot in that fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowÅ¿hip of Saints to which I Å¿tand related; thoÅ¿e whom we have found competently furniÅ¿hed

               <p>Ignorance and pride, and affectation of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, praiÅ¿e and a corrupt conÅ¿cience, and unÅ¿an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:48559:206"/> parts and gifts, and formal implantations into ChriÅ¿t without reality and power, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿aking the aÅ¿Å¿embling of our Å¿elves together, and aÅ¿piring unduly to prophecying without a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thereto; and many others that have been mentioned, theÅ¿e have given life to errours, and theÅ¿e have given Å¿trength to them alÅ¿o.</p>
               <p>But there are Å¿ome Å¿pecial cauÅ¿es of the growth of errours, divers from Å¿uch which have been already preÅ¿ented as the riÅ¿e of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The cenÅ¿ures of the Church are not duly exerciÅ¿ed to repreÅ¿Å¿e that inordinate luÅ¿ting after Å¿trange doctrine, and that pride, vain gloriouÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, vanity of Å¿pirit, and wantonneÅ¿Å¿e of mind, with which many Saints are too much carried, and are Å¿ick of; Not that I would have Saints caÅ¿t out of the Church, for every difference in judgement from their brethren, or diÅ¿Å¿enting in opinion; thoÅ¿e that have known me, have known that I have been evermore a Å¿tranger to Å¿uch rigid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e. I would not have Å¿o much as the peace of Å¿uch diÅ¿turbed in the leaÅ¿t kind by any, but if any opinion Å¿trike at the foundation, threatning the overturning of it, and be very deÅ¿tructive to the faith and holineÅ¿Å¿e of Saints, I think there is warrant enough, (and I hope I Å¿hall be able to make it out from Scripture) to proceed to the queÅ¿tioning and cenÅ¿uring of Å¿uch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons, who by other means cannot be reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:48559:207"/> And the neglecting of this ordinance of ChriÅ¿t is of evil conÅ¿equence unto the further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ripening of errour; for however it may be thought and Å¿poken by Å¿ome, that Church-cenÅ¿ures bring no light to men with them, nor can be effectual for the conviction of perÅ¿ons judgements (which hath truth in it,) yet the diÅ¿temper of Å¿pirit (from which errour, when it is groÅ¿Å¿e, doth as commonly ariÅ¿e as from weakneÅ¿Å¿e of judgement) and unÅ¿oberneÅ¿Å¿e of heart is healed and cured by Church cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ures.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Communion and fellowÅ¿hip with thoÅ¿e who are corrupt and unÅ¿ound in their opinions, is not forborn, but there is the Å¿ame liberty uÅ¿ed of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿ing with Å¿uch, and the Å¿ame intimacy and familiarity Å¿hewed, as with any others how Å¿ound Å¿oever; when yet the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿aith, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void them,</hi> Rom. 16. 17.

               <pb n="415" facs="tcp:48559:207"/>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But Å¿uch perÅ¿ons are Saints; why Å¿hould their Communion be declined?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Why doth God himÅ¿elf withdraw from Saints, and hide his face from them? is it not to humble them and make them aÅ¿hamed, and bring them to repentance? And may not, yea ought not we to withdraw from unÅ¿ound and corrupt perÅ¿ons (though they Å¿hould be Saints,) for the Å¿ame reaÅ¿ons? eÅ¿pecially Å¿eeing our own preÅ¿ervation is in it.</p>
               <p>Obj.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But it will make diviÅ¿ions among Saints to forbear the fellowÅ¿hip of Å¿uch, and it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce the common adverÅ¿arie, therefore for the Å¿candal that is in it, Å¿uch withdrawing muÅ¿t not be allowed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> A holding of Communion with Å¿uch, will at laÅ¿t cauÅ¿e diviÅ¿ion, and not a withdrawing from them, for Å¿uch who bring any other do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine by converÅ¿ing with Saints, do get a Party, and Å¿o make diviÅ¿ion. The ApoÅ¿tle declares whence diviÅ¿ion proceeds, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 17. not from thoÅ¿e who Å¿hun Communion with leavened per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons, but from Å¿uch who are corrupt and leaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Mark thoÅ¿e</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>who cauÅ¿e diviÅ¿ions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the doctrine that ye have received;</hi> Such perÅ¿ons who bring unÅ¿criptural doctrine cauÅ¿e the diviÅ¿ions, for by their crafty inÅ¿inuations they deceive the Å¿imple, and draw away diÅ¿ciples, and this ingenders a rent, for the reÅ¿t muÅ¿t oppoÅ¿e and reÅ¿iÅ¿t, unleÅ¿Å¿e they alÅ¿o will become diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:48559:208"/> and if they do appear for the truth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t the errour the reÅ¿t are carried away with, then there will be diviÅ¿ion following upon it.</p>
               <p>As for the glorying of the common adverÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, there is more occaÅ¿ion given him to glory at that union that is betwixt hereticks and errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perÅ¿ons, and Å¿uch who profeÅ¿Å¿e to be Saints; and the Å¿candal is greater, becauÅ¿e the AdverÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry will give it out they are all corrupt, they are unÅ¿ound, they are all hereticks, all erroneous corrupt perÅ¿ons, for they mix together, and at leaÅ¿t there is an allowance; this is juÅ¿tly more Å¿candalous then the other, nay the other is not Å¿candalous at all; but it is the glory of the Saints in the preÅ¿ence of their enemies, to keep themÅ¿elves from all corrupt things and perÅ¿ons, what profeÅ¿Å¿ion Å¿oever they make.</p>
               <p>3. There is a tampering with opinions that are unÅ¿ound, and with perÅ¿ons alÅ¿o who are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, by which means it comes to paÅ¿Å¿e that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lay themÅ¿elves under Å¿trong temptations, and through the righteous hand of the Lord they come to be left to errour, and become as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt as any. There are Å¿ome, and not a few, that take great delight to talk with all kind of perÅ¿ons, who hold any Å¿trange opinion, as bring any new doctrine, and if there be any book into which any poyÅ¿on of corrupt doctrine is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tilled, they will uÅ¿e all means to get Å¿uch a book, and will chooÅ¿e rather to read therein then in
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:48559:208"/> any other, till at length they be changed into the Å¿ame image, and be principled alike to the perÅ¿ons and books they are Å¿o converÅ¿ant with. Now this evil proceeds,</p>
               <p n="1">1. From an opinion that Å¿ome hold, that it is the duty of ChriÅ¿tians to try all things, and to keep that which is good; but the commandment of the ApoÅ¿tle is miÅ¿taken; for firÅ¿t, this trying reÅ¿pects all the doctrines and Å¿pirits of men that we are called neceÅ¿Å¿ary to partake of, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿ant in; Å¿o the doctrines of our own PaÅ¿tors and Teachers muÅ¿t be tryed, and of others alÅ¿o, whom providence leads us to hear, and it reÅ¿pects the knowledge of doctrines whereto we have not yet attained; but we are not by vertue of this commandment, to rake into all opinions that are or have been among ApoÅ¿tate ChriÅ¿tians; nor is it a duty to be alwayes trying, but we muÅ¿t be rooted, and grounded, and eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed as we have been taught. And this is a commandment of the ApoÅ¿tle, whereto we ought to attend; and we muÅ¿t leave the principles, and paÅ¿Å¿e on to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, that is, having laid them in the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we muÅ¿t build higher and higher upon them, till we come to a perfect man in ChriÅ¿t.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From a preÅ¿umption which perÅ¿ons have of their own Å¿trength, they think there is no danger, but that they Å¿hall be able well enough to diÅ¿co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the evill in any opinion, and not be hurt by it, and in the interim they may read or hear Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:48559:209"/> that may edifie them. But indeed the moÅ¿t of theÅ¿e are unacquainted with their own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, and they know not the depth of Satan till they fall by them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From Å¿ome decay of appetite, Å¿o farre as concernes feeding upon wholÅ¿ome nouriÅ¿hing truths, for it is a Å¿ymptome of a weak diÅ¿temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Å¿tomack, that it would behold variety of meats, but it cannot feed upon any; Å¿o when the Å¿oule is carried out to curioÅ¿ity, to be looking and pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all things, that any are carried to, it is to be feared that it feeds upon nothing which may build it up and Å¿trengthen it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Error comes to be Å¿pread by the temerity, invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilancy, inÅ¿obriety, &amp; imprudence of many ChriÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; Å¿ome are Å¿udden in entertaining of opinions, &amp; not Å¿ober; Å¿ome are cloÅ¿e and Å¿ecret in their Å¿earch and enquiry after them, and never diÅ¿cover any thing till they be formed within them, and till themÅ¿elves come to be formed into the Å¿imilitude of them, and then it becomes an hard work to deÅ¿troy that which is Å¿o firmly received; and Å¿ome over-match themÅ¿elves, while they oppoÅ¿e their underÅ¿tanding parts and abilities to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect and Å¿harpneÅ¿Å¿e of apprehenÅ¿ion, and dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e of wit, and vaÅ¿tneÅ¿Å¿e of parts, and Å¿trength of braine, that falÅ¿e Teachers and Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers have; by which means it comes to paÅ¿Å¿e that they are eaÅ¿ily overcome, and advantage is given to the erroneous to propagate their corrupt opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:48559:209"/> Whereas there ought to be great delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, much conÅ¿ultation, open heartedneÅ¿Å¿e alÅ¿o in perÅ¿ons to their owne PaÅ¿tors and OverÅ¿eers, or dear friends whom they may confide in, and a calling out for help where it is moÅ¿t like to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded, that Å¿uch doctrines may be debated upon equall terms, before they be received.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The countenance and encouragement that is given to perÅ¿ons that bring unÅ¿ound and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cripturall doctrine; and the applauÅ¿es and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es wherewith they are followed by Å¿ome high ones, and holy ones, (it may be for Å¿ome parts that are eminent in them, and for Å¿ome dreÅ¿Å¿e of holineÅ¿Å¿e that they appear in) do give life and Å¿trength to Å¿uch doctrines; for when great ones and godly ones are become admirers and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of Å¿uch perÅ¿ons, and harbour them, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them, the eyes of others are thereby turned after them; and there will be many that in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be found to Å¿trengthen the hands of Å¿uch evill workers and Å¿educers that do traverÅ¿e the land, and to Å¿trengthen their errors alÅ¿o.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If it once come to paÅ¿Å¿e that any eminent ones in office, intereÅ¿t, abilities, graces, upon whom the eyes of many people are, and who are leading perÅ¿ons in the places where they live, and after whoÅ¿e example many go; if any Å¿uch be left of God to Å¿trange doctrine, they will draw away many diÅ¿ciples after them, and the land will in a Å¿hort time be filled with error, if there be not
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:48559:210"/> Å¿ome mercifull providences to prevent the diffuÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it: And when it begins to take hold of Saints, it is moÅ¿t likely to increaÅ¿e, for then there is honour put upon it, while it lodgeth in Å¿uch Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, while temperizers and Å¿elf-Å¿eeking perÅ¿ons (which were men of carnall and low principles) harboured it, it was of baÅ¿e repute and proÅ¿pered not, but gets a better name by getting into heads and hearts of beleevers.</p>
               <p>The third thing that comes to be diÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿ed is the meanes of cure how perÅ¿ons may come to be healed of errors, and errors may come to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿troyed in them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There muÅ¿t be an encountring with Å¿uch er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous doctrines, and they muÅ¿t be brought to Å¿criptural tryall, and there they muÅ¿t be arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and thence they muÅ¿t be condemned. The reaÅ¿on is, becauÅ¿e they are preÅ¿ented with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of Scripture, Scripture is made uÅ¿e of to uÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er them in, elÅ¿e they could get no entrance, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Scripture muÅ¿t throw them out again; And Seducers mouths will not be Å¿topped any other way, nor will their followers be undeceived any other way; Therefore there is a neceÅ¿Å¿ity that the truth Å¿hould be held out, and Å¿trongly forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with Scripture and with agrument, by which the mind may be filled with light, and that error Å¿hould be confuted, and the nakedneÅ¿Å¿e and Å¿or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didneÅ¿Å¿e thereof detected, that thoÅ¿e that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous may come to be aÅ¿hamed, that have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heared

And look how many wayes error hath been propagated, Å¿uch wayes Å¿hould be taken for the Å¿preading of truth. The contrary truths to the grand errors of this age ought to be held out in words that cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by preaching, printing, letters written, private communication and Å¿uggeÅ¿tion by open conferences alÅ¿o and diÅ¿putes, and happy are thoÅ¿e that have gifts and hearts to contribute any thing this way. See we the Å¿edulity and induÅ¿try of <hi>Paul</hi> this way, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 31. <hi>for the space of three yeeres I coaÅ¿ed not</hi> (Å¿aid he) <hi>to warne every one of you night and day with tears.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The care and vigilancy of the Churches of ChriÅ¿t, and of the Officers and OverÅ¿eers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, muÅ¿t be Å¿hewed towards their own mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, which relate to them, for the healing of any that have been Å¿haken, or have departed from the faith; for, for that end are they aÅ¿Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated together, that they might watch over one another; and the Elders are principally called forth to this work, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 31. <hi>Therefore Watch;</hi> why, what is the matter? and he tels us, becauÅ¿e grievous wolves Å¿hall enter in among

To Å¿end to all Å¿uch, (who are at diÅ¿tance from them, and live in dangerous places) to know their faith, leaÅ¿t they Å¿hould be tempted, 1 <hi>TheÅ¿.</hi> 3. 5. which place, though it may reÅ¿pect the grace of faith, which through affliction may be Å¿haken, yet it will hold in proportion in reference to the doctrine of faith. And though the ApoÅ¿tle declareth what he did, yet therein he is a pattetne what thoÅ¿e that have a flock committed to them ought to do; for without doubt what power the ApoÅ¿tles had for edification, and not for deÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, over all the Churches and Members there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Å¿ame hath each Church, and the Officers thereof, over thoÅ¿e that Å¿tand related to them. And Å¿uch who Å¿o belong to Å¿uch Churches, and have Å¿uch OverÅ¿eers, are bound to render an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in a ChriÅ¿tian way, it is a duty by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tle <hi>Peters</hi> Precept, but much rather is there an obligation where there is Å¿uch a relation.</p>
               <p>2. It is neceÅ¿Å¿ary for the Churches to put this burden upon Å¿uch members of theirs, where Å¿uch
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:48559:211"/> danger is of Å¿educers, (if they will count it a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den) to abÅ¿tain from the fellowÅ¿hip of Å¿uch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons who are not Å¿ound in doctrines among them, becauÅ¿e the ApoÅ¿tle requires it, <hi>Rom</hi> 16. 17. 2 <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 8, 9, 10. and becauÅ¿e there is a double benefit in it. 1. To Å¿uch which erre Å¿o dangerouÅ¿ly, they may come to be awakened and afterward aÅ¿hamed. 2. To thoÅ¿e that Å¿hun them, and decline them, they come to be kept thereby, and preÅ¿erved from their errour. 3. It is the duty of the Church and watchmen thereof, to withÅ¿tand Å¿uch who are falÅ¿e teachers, and who deceive thoÅ¿e of their flock by their lies, as <hi>Paul</hi> reÅ¿iÅ¿ted <hi>Elimas,</hi> who would turn away the Deputy from the faith, and as the Å¿hepheard is bound to chaÅ¿e away the wolfe for the Å¿afety of the flock. 4. The Church and Elders there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ought to be warning Å¿uch of theirs that are in danger, that is, to be preÅ¿enting them with the evil and danger of Å¿uch doctrine, and Å¿hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them the horrid effects and conÅ¿equences which will follow upon it, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 31. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how I warned you,</hi> and in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. he Å¿hews the evil conÅ¿equences of denying the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿urrection, which they Å¿aw not, but made light of it, but the ApoÅ¿tle had looked into it, &amp; did faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully hold it forth to them. 5. The Church of ChriÅ¿t and the Rulers thereof ought to reject and caÅ¿t out Å¿uch among theirs who are heady and high, and are not reclaimed from Å¿uch errours
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:48559:212"/> which they have Å¿ucked in from Å¿uch Å¿educers, which have been among them, after they have clearly held out the truth, and detected the contrary errour, and confuted it; and after they have admoniÅ¿hed and warned Å¿uch, once, or twice, or thrice, or while there is hope. It is clear from the ApoÅ¿tles example, in delivering up <hi>Hymeneus</hi> for no other fault but for denying the ReÅ¿urrection, and troubling others with that doctrine. And alÅ¿o from the ApoÅ¿tles direction given to <hi>Titus, Tit.</hi> 3. 10, 11. <hi>An heretick after once or twice admonition reject, &amp;c.</hi> And indeed <hi>avoiding</hi> Å¿uch, and <hi>not receiving</hi> Å¿uch, nor Å¿aying <hi>Gods Å¿peed</hi> to Å¿uch, is an high cenÅ¿ure, little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that of delivering up to Satan.</p>
               <p>Obj.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the queÅ¿tion may be, what edification there can be in paÅ¿Å¿ing Å¿uch a Å¿entence upon one that erres in doctrine, either to him that is Å¿o cenÅ¿ured, or to others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> GroÅ¿Å¿e errours or hereÅ¿ies are not fallen into, eÅ¿pecially not perÅ¿iÅ¿ted in (after a cleare light held out) through Å¿imple ignorance, but through Å¿ome diÅ¿temper of the Will, and Å¿ome temptation upon the Å¿pirit. Now though the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure of the Church hath no aptitude in it to give light where it was wanting to open their eyes, to rectifie an erring judgement, to convince the conÅ¿cience, or Å¿atisfie doubts and Å¿cruples, which did ariÅ¿e through Å¿imple ignorance, yet the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure of the Church may be a means to heal the
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:48559:212"/> will, and to remove the temptation from the Å¿pirit, what ever it be which may obÅ¿truct the right exerciÅ¿e of that light, and underÅ¿tanding which Å¿uch perÅ¿ons have; and firÅ¿t the cenÅ¿ure of the Church may occaÅ¿ion a more Å¿erious and deep Å¿earching into the truth, or falÅ¿hood of doctrines, and may cure that precipitancy and headineÅ¿Å¿e, and raÅ¿hneÅ¿Å¿e, in entertaining and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging in doctrines that are not Å¿ound and Å¿crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural. There is a vanity of Å¿pirit, which luÅ¿teth after new opinions, which cauÅ¿eth Å¿uch facilenes in receiving, that doctrines are no Å¿ooner pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ented, but they are taken up, but Church-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings may be a means to bring on Å¿obriety. 2. That partiality which is in perÅ¿ons in reference unto thoÅ¿e whom they reÅ¿pect and affect, may come to be healed, for nothing is more frequent then to hold opinions and tenents, with reÅ¿pect to perÅ¿ons, but this diÅ¿temper is many times beÅ¿t cured, through the execution of Church power 3. If the truth be departed from for advantage Å¿ake, that perÅ¿ons thereby may riÅ¿e up to great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er honour or preferment, Church diÅ¿cipline gives a check many times to Å¿uch luÅ¿ts of the fleÅ¿h, that they cannot prevaile with that Å¿trength as before they did; when the love of them carried perÅ¿ons to corrupt ingagements that way. 4. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons are ingaged to that opinion which they have turned aÅ¿ide to, leaÅ¿t they Å¿hould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted fickle and wavering, when yet they
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:48559:213"/> want Scripture-Å¿trength to maintain them; but this perverÅ¿enes and obÅ¿tinacy is beÅ¿t cured by the admonitions and withdrawings of the Church from Å¿uch perÅ¿ons. 5. And if there Å¿hould be any darkneÅ¿Å¿e in the judgement, in reference to plain and clear doctrines, where Å¿uch darkneÅ¿Å¿e was not before; it is argument to me that God hath juÅ¿tly put out their eyes, in reference to Å¿omething that hath diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ed him, and till they have been aÅ¿hamed, and have Å¿hewed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, God will not diÅ¿pel nor Å¿catter the clouds, nor clear up their judgements; Now Church admonition is the beÅ¿t expedient to bring them to repentance, as the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿peaks of <hi>Hymeneus, I have delivered him up to Satan</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>that he may learne not to blaÅ¿pheme,</hi> that is, by denying a doctrine which he ought to have profeÅ¿Å¿ed. And Å¿o Å¿uch Å¿cales of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance which were by Å¿in contracted, are by Church-cenÅ¿ure removed many times.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>But what if Å¿uch perÅ¿ons be very holy in their lives, and very profitable in their Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, muÅ¿t they notwithÅ¿tanding undergo the cenÅ¿ure of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. There is no holineÅ¿Å¿e but what flows from the doctrine of the GoÅ¿pel, rightly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and held by faith. Therefore Å¿o long as they waver in the faith in points of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment and moment, their holineÅ¿Å¿e muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿Å¿ity be waved alÅ¿o; the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿aith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:48559:213"/> 7, 8. <hi>Though I or an Angel from heaven bring any other GoÅ¿pel</hi> (and yet he means it of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciÅ¿ion held by Å¿ome as neceÅ¿Å¿ary to Å¿alvation) <hi>let him be accurÅ¿ed.</hi> 2. Such perÅ¿ons that are pertinacious in a corrupt opinion, are evil leaven, and their Communion cannot be Å¿o profitable, as it is like to be hurtful to the fellowÅ¿hip to which they do belong. 3. If they be Saints which do Å¿o greatly erre from the faith, there ought to be Å¿o much the more compaÅ¿Å¿ion Å¿hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, and the greateÅ¿t love and compaÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that can be Å¿hewed lies in this, to uÅ¿e the laÅ¿t remedy to them, when other remedies fail, and are ineffectual; and it is the greateÅ¿t cruelty to withhold any means which God hath Å¿ancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for the healing of Å¿uch, as from <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears.</p>
               <p>5. What one Church of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t doth this way in the execution of cenÅ¿ure, juÅ¿tly and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to rule, all the Churches ought to ratifie; for if Å¿uch who are bound by any Church on earth, be bound alÅ¿o in heaven, then all the Churches in the world have not power to acquit or loÅ¿e from it; therefore in their walking towards Å¿uch perÅ¿ons (great or Å¿mall) they ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it, by having no Communion nor fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip with Å¿uch, that Å¿o Å¿uch perÅ¿ons may come to Å¿ee the miÅ¿erable condition that they are in, and may be aÅ¿hamed; and if any Churches or ChriÅ¿tians Å¿hould walk otherwiÅ¿e, they Å¿in againÅ¿t
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:48559:214"/> ChriÅ¿ts ordinance, and harden Å¿uch perÅ¿ons in their Å¿in, and hinder their repentance, and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the truth, and will draw the blood of Å¿uch Å¿ouls upon their heads.</p>
               <p>If this courÅ¿e were held with Å¿uch who erre groÅ¿Å¿ely, and will not be healed, it would awaken thoÅ¿e who have left their firÅ¿t faith, and are tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned after fables, and might recover them, and would bring a trembling upon the reÅ¿t, that Å¿tand firme and unÅ¿haken, and might preÅ¿erve them from the like temptations, and then there would be no cauÅ¿e for the interpoÅ¿ing of the MagiÅ¿trate, which Å¿ome do reliÅ¿h Å¿o evilly.</p>
               <p>The fourth and laÅ¿t thing that I am to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cuÅ¿Å¿e is, what the preÅ¿ervatives are by which perÅ¿ons may be kept, in times in which errours are rife, and the danger great in that reÅ¿pect.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let every perÅ¿on that pretends to Å¿aintÅ¿hip look to his implantation into ChriÅ¿t, that it be right and true, and that it be firme and Å¿ure, and then it is to be hoped that he will abide in the Vine, and the Vine in him, and then he is more likely to Å¿tand faÅ¿t in the faith, for there is one that is able to keep him from falling, and will keep him, and if he fall he Å¿hall riÅ¿e againe; for there is one that is able to raiÅ¿e him, and will raiÅ¿e him; The greateÅ¿t Å¿ecurity of the Saints, that they Å¿hall not depart from the faith, is in their union and communion with ChriÅ¿t.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let perÅ¿ons commit themÅ¿elves to God, to be
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:48559:214"/> kept by him, who can Å¿trengthen and Å¿ettle, and eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h thoÅ¿e that reÅ¿t on him, and wait for him; while perÅ¿ons have leaned to their own underÅ¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and have not looked up to the rock that is higher then they, and come out of themÅ¿elves, and put their truÅ¿t in him, and begged his teaching and leading, they have become vain in their thoughts, and have erred from the truth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let perÅ¿ons get a good root of knowledge within themÅ¿elves, and not attain onely to a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall knowledge of things, but come up to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular knowledge of them, and know all things in the cauÅ¿es thereof, Å¿o farre as Scripture gives light, or as they have been taught; for then, though Å¿ome other thing may be preÅ¿ented to them, then what they have received, yet the reaÅ¿ons of the things which they have beleeved, will not be Å¿o Å¿oon anÅ¿wered in their Å¿ouls. If perÅ¿ons have but a forme of knowledge within them, it is Å¿oon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturned.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let the love of the truth be laboured after, as well as the knowledge of it, for perÅ¿ons will be unwilling to relinquiÅ¿h that truth which they have found much Å¿weetneÅ¿Å¿e in.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Let the Scriptures be diligently Å¿earched in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and peruÅ¿ed, and Å¿tudied, and let them be compared together, and let Scripture intepret it Å¿elfe, and let one Scripture give the Å¿enÅ¿e of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scripture, when perÅ¿ons take up Å¿ome one or two Å¿ingle Å¿criptures, and runne away with them,
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:48559:215"/> without comparing them with other Scriptures, they are led aÅ¿ide to error.</p>
               <p n="6">6. ChriÅ¿tians ought to take heed whom they hear, what they hear, and how they hear, becauÅ¿e of many Seducers and Deceivers, that are gone abroad into the world, and becauÅ¿e there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Å¿pirits of AntichriÅ¿t, who yet pretend to ChriÅ¿t.</p>
               <p n="7">7. ChriÅ¿tians ought to become wiÅ¿e unto Å¿obri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, <hi>and not to think of themÅ¿elves above what is meet,</hi> but to have humble and low thoughts of themÅ¿elves, for if once ChriÅ¿tians be lifted up, they readily fall in this Å¿nare of the Devill, which is Error and HereÅ¿ie.</p>
               <p n="8">8. ChriÅ¿tians ought to walk up to that light of truth that they have attained to, becauÅ¿e there is a promiÅ¿e belonging to Å¿uch who will live in and practiÅ¿e the truths which they know, <hi>John</hi> 7. 17.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Saints ought to conÅ¿ider that they have no more of the grace of faith, then they hold of the doctrin of faith, for they therfore beleeve becauÅ¿e they have Å¿uch a word of God to ground their belief upon; if then they hold not that Word, their belief will fall with it, and then muÅ¿t needs be Å¿haken, as much in the grace of faith, as they are in the ground of faith.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Let them conÅ¿ider that there is no godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e but what grows out of the GoÅ¿pel, and Å¿prings from the truths of it, if therefore the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of grace in ChriÅ¿t be once overturned in the Å¿oule, all godlineÅ¿Å¿e will be Å¿oon overturned with it. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 3. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 1.</p>
               <p n="11">
                  <pb n="431" facs="tcp:48559:215"/> 11. Let them conÅ¿ider that if once they become unÅ¿table in the faith, they become unÅ¿table in all their wayes, for it is as when a tree is not firmly &amp; deeply and Å¿urely rooted in the earth, but is looÅ¿e in the ground, it growes not, flouriÅ¿heth not, nor is fruitful like to other trees; therfore Å¿aith ChriÅ¿t, <hi>unleÅ¿Å¿e you abide in me,</hi> that is, firmly and Å¿urely hold me, <hi>ye cannot bring forth fruit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. Let all ChriÅ¿tians take heed how they hold the truth in unrighteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, how they put away a good conÅ¿cience in any thing and Å¿o tempt God, leÅ¿t God give them up to darkneÅ¿Å¿e, as a puniÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Å¿uch an offence.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Let every ChriÅ¿tian joyn to Å¿ome Church of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t that walks cloÅ¿ely with God in the truth, that by the watchings of others he may be the better kept. This is regular walking and God will be Å¿ure to bleÅ¿Å¿e it.</p>
               <p>4 Let not any ChriÅ¿tians run into temptations, leaÅ¿t God Å¿hould leave them under the power of them, and Å¿uffer them to be overcome of them; but if they hear or read a doctrine that is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to what they received, let them with much fear and trembling hear and read it; and with much looking up to heaven for guidance; &amp; let them be Å¿low in entertaining that which is new &amp; Å¿trange to them; and after much examination &amp; conÅ¿ulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and abundant confirmation out of Scripture, let them do it. If Saints will walk in this way, the God of truth and grace will be with them, &amp; they Å¿hall be kept unto Å¿alvation.</p>
