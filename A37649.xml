            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have in a former Treatiſe Vindicated certain Scriptures, which I produced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Mr. <hi>Knowles</hi> his abſurd and deſtructive opinion againſt the Divinity of Chriſt, from ſuch corrupt gloſſes which he did put upon them, in a Printed paper of his, Intituled, <hi>A friendly debate on a weighty ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<pb facs="tcp:48559:3"/> &amp;c.</hi> And in my clearing of <hi>Ioh. 8. 58.</hi> (which he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly darkned and falſified, by the interpretation which he put upon it) I encountred with the many arguments and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſenſes of Scripture which he had made uſe of, and in which he had placed the whole ſtrength he had, for the upholding of that his heterodox and dangerous do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which he vented in <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> with too great ſucceſs, to the diſturbing of the faith of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: And whether <hi>I</hi> have not razed his whole building to the
<pb facs="tcp:48559:3"/> very ground, (which in three po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions he ſet up &amp; fortified) and whether <hi>I</hi> have not digged up the very foundation of it, &amp; taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way every ſupporter of it; <hi>I</hi> leave it to the judicious, unprejudiced, and diſ-ingaged Readers to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine betwixt us.</p>
            <p>Truth (after a little time of patient expectance) will prevaile againſt, and triumph over er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, becauſe it hath the God of truth to engage for it, who can ſtrengthen any weak contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inſtrument (whom he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to imploy) to become migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb facs="tcp:48559:4"/> in the defence of it.</p>
            <p>My hope is, that enough hath already been repreſented to ſatisfie all ingenuous dubious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons concerning the truth of Chriſts Godhead, and therefore it is not abſolutely needful to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the ſetting forth of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Treatiſe: But leſt there ſhould be any occaſion of glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing adminiſtred to him, or others, Becauſe <hi>I</hi> replyed only to ſome part of his writing or Printed paper, and not to the whole; and leſt he ſhould comfort himſelf with conceits of the unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs
<pb facs="tcp:48559:4"/> of that which is behind of it, and is unreplyed to: and leſt the truth ſhould ſuffer in ſuch Scriptures which remain unexamined by me, by his wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them from their genuine ſenſe, and my not freeing of them from ſuch abuſe; <hi>I</hi> have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to carry on my reply unto the remainder of his Book, that nothing that is material therein may be objected againſt me, as pretermitted by me.</p>
            <p>And becauſe <hi>I</hi> did well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that ſome would lie at advantages, and would give it
<pb facs="tcp:48559:5"/> out that Mr. <hi>Knowles</hi> his book was never anſwered; if any part be unanſwered, and would object againſt me, that <hi>I</hi> was not able to defend all the Scriptures and arguments produced by my ſelf, and impugned by him, but did ſhamefully deſert them, and not reſcue them from the force of his battery which he made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them: And becauſe in the vindicating of my arguments, <hi>I</hi> foreſaw that <hi>I</hi> ſhould be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated to diſcuſs and diſcover the weightineſs of the point in controverſie, and that it is not
<pb facs="tcp:48559:5"/> ſo light and trivial as ſome would make it, but that it is of higheſt concernment, and that all oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Godhead of Chriſt do oppugn mens ſalvation, and that ſuch an opinion that gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayeth Chriſts Diety, is no leſſe then damnable; therefore <hi>I</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in my former Treatiſe to compleat my reply, and therein to attempt the giving ſatisfaction in that point (which only to mention was greatly offenſive to many precious Chriſtians) <hi>viz.</hi> that Faith in Chriſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a meer creature, and
<pb facs="tcp:48559:6"/> nothing more, is a falſe Faith, and cannot ſave; it therefore now concerned me (in point of Truth) to finiſh the work which <hi>I</hi> began; if God ſhall be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſhine upon my Endeavors, ſo far as to caſt in any light to dark ſouls thereby, that they may be able (not only to diſcern the falſhood of ſuch a Doctrine, but) to ſee into the horridneſs thereof, <hi>I</hi> have my reward; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>I</hi> lie down at Gods foot, waiting upon him, to accompliſh his own glory in what way he pleaſeth, aſſuring my ſelf that his
<pb facs="tcp:48559:6"/> wiſdom and goodneſs is ſuch, that he will both find out time, and means to undeceive poor ſouls that belong to him, and will deliver them out of the ſnare of Satan, who captivates them for a little ſpace (while his pleaſure is) for their humbling; and leaving this work in Gods hand, and thy ſelf alſo,</p>

            <head>A Vindication, or further confirmation of ſome other Scriptures, produced to prove the Divinity of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> diſtort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and miſerably wreſted and abuſed by Mr <hi>John Knowles.</hi> &amp;c.</head>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He next Scripture that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced for the confirmation of the Diety of Jeſus Chriſt, (after <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 58.) was <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 8. <hi>I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, ſaith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he encounters with this Text, and would evade the force of it, in theſe words: <hi>How can you demonſtrate</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that theſe are the words of Chriſt,</hi> and do relate to him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> 1. I do demonſtrate it from that agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which theſe words in the 8. verſe have with the words of the 11. and of the 17. verſes, which words of both places do refer to Chriſt, by his own confeſſion, and without the contradiction of any, as the 13. and 17. verſes do evidence to the Reader, in which it appears to be Chriſt that aſſumed the Titles of <hi>Alpha and Omega</hi> to himſelf.</p>
               <p>2. I do collect it, becauſe Chriſt is one of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48559:8"/> ſpeakers which we uſually meet with in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, but the Father is rarely or never found to be a ſpeaker through this whole Book.</p>
               <p>3. Becauſe the things that are in this Book repreſented, are given by the Father unto Chriſt, but are ſhewed and ſignified by Chriſt unto his ſervants; now this is one thing that Chriſt ſhewed, which reſpected himſelf what he was, <hi>I am</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Alpha and Omega.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Becauſe there are no more ſpeakers in this Chapter, but Chriſt and <hi>John,</hi> who can be made evidently to appear; therefore all that is ſpoken in it, muſt be referred to one of the two; but the 8. verſe cannot be referred to <hi>John,</hi> therefore to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>5. Becauſe it concludes the prooeme, and gives a period to the Preface, (as <hi>Pareus</hi> ſhews upon the place,) <hi>John</hi> had repreſented him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in the clouds, in the 7. verſe, and then in the words of the 8. verſe, ſets him before men, (for the conſolation of the righteous, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the wicked) as preſent, calling to them, <hi>I am Alpha and Omega, &amp;c.</hi> who will make doubt of my coming? who can intercept it? <hi>I am Alpha and Omega, &amp;c.</hi> But he imagines other Arguments will be made uſe of, to prove this place to refer to Chriſt, and diſputes againſt them, his words are theſe:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You will peradventure ſay, that the thing is</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:48559:8"/> 
                  <hi>evident, in that he is called Lord, or you will bring the Teſtimony of learned Authors, who have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted the words as ſpoken by Chriſt:</hi> And he confutes both theſe reaſons, and ſaith, <hi>God, or the Father, diſtinct from Chriſt, is called Lord,</hi> Act. 3. 19. 20. <hi>&amp;c. And</hi> Beza (ſaith he) <hi>conceived that theſe words are ſpoken of God, abſolutely taken. And</hi> Pareus <hi>confeſſeth certain Orthodox Interpreters do attribute the words to God abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely conſidered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> The Title <hi>Lord,</hi> becauſe it is rarely at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the Father in the New Teſtament, and when it is attributed to him, it is done with ſuch clearneſs, that it is eaſily diſcerned, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is firſt commonly attributed to Chriſt, therefore it may be a ground of a probable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that Chriſt is meant by it; but a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Argument cannot be deducted from it; therefore I wave it; and it had been wiſdom if he had done ſo alſo, till he had diſcerned that I had made uſe of it as an Argument. As for learned Interpreters, though I honour them much, yet it hath not been my cuſtom to bottom the ſenſe that I put upon Scriptures upon them; but to prove it from the Scripture, either the Text it ſelf or context, or ſome other parallel place; therefore he might have ſpared his labour in citing Authors, unleſs I had provoked him thereto.</p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:48559:9"/>
               <p> But if he will produce Authors, why will he offer wrong to the Authors whom he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth? and make them ſpeak that which they ſpeak not? that hath been the way to uphold a rotten tenent, and he treads in that way. I cannot find the words he cites in <hi>Beza,</hi> and he mentions not the place; and if he can ſhew them in <hi>Beza,</hi> I can ſhew that <hi>Beza</hi> contradicts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. If <hi>Beza</hi> have ſo expreſſed himſelf, proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly he would do it when he came to give the ſenſe of the place, but there his words are theſe: <hi>Chriſtus hic loquitur ut aeternus Deus, acſi diceret, ego is ſum ante quem nihil eſt, immo per quem factum eſt quicquid factum eſt, quicque ut omnia intereant, ſuperſtes illis omnibus mane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, &amp;c.</hi> That is, <hi>Chriſt here ſpeaks as the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal God, as if he ſhould ſay, I am he before whom there is nothing, yea and by whom every thing is made that is made, and am one who do abide, and am ſurviving when all other things periſh.</hi> As for <hi>Pareus,</hi> I confeſs he cites his words aright, and yet abuſeth him egregiouſly; for though he grants that ſome Orthodox Writers do apply theſe words to God, abſolutely conſidered, yet he doth not grant that they are Orthodox in their Interpretation of that Text, but diſputes againſt them, and renders reaſons why the words muſt be applyed to Chriſt. And in the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48559:9"/> very place from whence he fetcheth thoſe words of <hi>Pareus,</hi> which he mentions in his Margin, theſe words immediately follow, <hi>cauſas tamen evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes ſententiae huic obſtare, prius oſtendi,</hi> that is, though ſome Orthodox Interpreters do apply theſe words to God abſolutely taken, or to the Trinity, yet I have before ſhewed manifeſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which do croſs this Opinion of theirs. Now he mentions the former words of this Author, and ſilenceth theſe latter words, and ſo deals unkindly and uncandidly with him.</p>
               <p>But he ſaith, <hi>We muſt betake our ſelves to reaſon, whereby the Spirit may convince us, of whom the Text in controverſies is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</hi>

And this he might have obſerved from <hi>Beza,</hi> had he been willing to have had his eyes opened.</p>
               <p>As for the Gloſs that he makes upon the words, I confuted it formerly in part, and have ſhewed in my other Treatiſe, that by <hi>beginning</hi> the firſt part of time is meant, and that the Verb or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle (was) ſhews a preexiſtence before the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, or before time was, and not that Chriſt had his firſt exiſtence then when the beginning was; for the heavens and the earth had their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence then when time firſt was in the beginning
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48559:16"/> of it, and ſubſiſted together with it, as <hi>Moſes</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords it; but the Word was before it, and ſo was eternal, for nothing was before the beginning but eternity. And whereas he makes this to be the ſenſe of theſe words, <hi>The Word was with God; This Jeſus Chriſt was a delight to the moſt high God, and did converſe with him;</hi> reſtraining high God to the Father, and excluding Chriſt, it is but the venting of his own conceit in ſtead of Truth; for God there is taken perſonally, and not eſſentially, as I have ſhewed before often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times; and the meaning is, the perſon of the Son was with the perſon of the Father from all eternity, and was a delight before the world was founded, as from <hi>Pro.</hi> 8. appears, <hi>He was as one brought up with the Father from everlaſting, and was daily his delight.</hi> But the ſenſe that he puts upon the laſt words <hi>(viz. and the Word was a God)</hi> is the moſt groſs of all, and palpably cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, <hi>viz. This Jeſus Chriſt had power committed to him, whereby he might repreſent the moſt High God:</hi> And the reaſon which he renders doth not make it more tollerable, <hi>viz. the name God is common to God and creatures:</hi> for I have ſhewed, that never any ſingle perſon was called God ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely without limitation and reſtriction. And in this place it is ſaid, that Chriſt was God from the firſt, that he was, and he was when the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning was; and it is not ſaid that he began to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48559:17"/> be when the beginning was, therefore he was before, and conſequently he was God before; and it will follow that he was God from eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and not in regard of any power committed to him, whereby he might repreſent the moſt high God; for there was neither heaven nor earth when he was God, over whom to exerciſe any power, nor any creature to whom to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent God. And I have ſhewed that power which he had, was power in himſelf (as life was in himſelf) and was not, neither could be power committed to him, power in him being ſuch as no creature was capable of, by which he at firſt created, and doth yet uphold the world, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3.</p>
               <p>And whereas he gives reaſons from this text, why Chriſt ſhould not be the moſt high God, viz. <hi>Becauſe he is diſtinguiſhed from God, and God cannot be diſtinguiſhed from himſelf,</hi> he himſelf anſwers it by the mention which he makes of perſonality, Chriſt is diſtinguiſhed from God taken perſonally, <hi>viz.</hi> for the Father, from the perſon of the Father is Chriſt diſtinguiſhed, but not from God eſſentially taken, nor from the eſſence of the Father, for ſo he and his Father are one. But he takes not upon him to anſwer us in this diſtinction, and to overthrow it, though he knows that our great ſtrength lies in it, but inſteed of anſwering, chargeth us to ſay that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48559:17"/> which we ſay not, <hi>viz.</hi> that we call the Father God by way of eminency, and diſputes againſt this, as inconſiſtent to that coequality which we hold, and ſhelters himſelf under it. But he wrongs us, for we ſay the Son is called God as diſtinct from the Father, but not by way of eminency, they cannot both be eminent one above the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and yet coequal. That which follows of <hi>The God</hi> and <hi>A God</hi> which he flies to, as a reaſon why Chriſt is not the moſt high God, I have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered before, and need ſay no more of it.</p>

                  <hi>Rep.</hi> This metaphorical preſence, in actions of grace and favours, (which he would have to be the ſole meaning of the words, <hi>I will be with thee)</hi> doth not exclude the eſſential preſence, but doth rather include it; for how is Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48559:18"/> to do all good to his Apoſtles and Diſciples in all places of the world, and in all conditions and neceſſities, in which they might be, and at all times, and yet not be eſſentially preſent with them? If he can declare it, let him declare it; In the mean time that parallel place, (which he cites from <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 3. compared with chap. 32. 9.) is againſt him, for God is inabled to do good to all, (and ſo to <hi>Jacob)</hi> by his eſſential preſence with all, and in all, and ſo with <hi>Jacob,</hi> and in <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob.</hi> And though God have all the Angels to wait upon him, and all the creatures at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to go for him, and to do for him what he appoints, yet if he were not eſſentially preſent himſelf with all, and in all, he could not ſupply all with all good that they want; for he could not ſee all and know all, if he were not preſent in all, if he did not fill all, and if all did not live and move and had not being in him. Therefore the Lord argues in <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 24. from his filling all, to his knowing all, the words are theſe, <hi>Can any hide himſelf in ſecret places, that I ſhall not ſee him?</hi> do not I fill heaven and earth, ſaith the Lord? and if this be ſo of God, that he works all by his preſence with all, then it is ſo of Chriſt alſo; and the words <hi>I will be with you,</hi> though they may extend to actions of love and kindneſs, and may compriſe well dealing and doing good within them, yet they do properly hold out the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48559:18"/> way and means in which Chriſt will be helpful to them, he is with them alwaies to take notice of their condition, and to apply himſelf thereto, and Chriſt doth aſſure them, that though he ſhall be bodily abſent from them, and in heaven, yet in the eternal Spirit, in the divine nature, he is alwaies preſent with them: In which ſenſe (he ſaith) that he the Son of man (though upon earth in his fleſh) was yet according to his diety in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>John</hi> 3. 13. and <hi>chap.</hi> 17. 24.</p>
               <p>But he goes on, and ſaith, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with his Meſſengers, and deals well with them, when he doth inſtruct, comfort, ſtrengthen and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect them; and all theſe he doth in his abſence by his Spirit, whom the Father hath ſent in his name.</hi> John 14. 26. And he inſtanceth in inſtruction, and ſaith, <hi>Chriſt inſtructed his Apoſtles, but not immediately; for the Spirit (ſaith he) that came in Chriſts name, and received of his, was the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by which Ieſus Chriſt did work:</hi> And he cites <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 13, 14, 15. for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> I have ſhewed already that theſe opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of grace do not hinder the eſſential pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt, according to his Godhead, with the Apoſtles, but do rather imply it; but he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes it, and ſaith he doth all theſe things in his abſence by his Spirit. Now though there be a truth in it, that Chriſt being in heaven in fleſh, and abſent from earth, ſo far as reſpects the fleſh,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48559:19"/> doth effect all things by the Spirit, yet it is not onely falſe, but fooliſh in the ſenſe that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it, and in the words that he expreſſeth it in.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſhall readily grant it in a ſenſe, that Chriſt works all by the Spirit, and that there is an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of working among the perſons in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head; and in this order the Father works by the Son, and by the Spirit; and the Son works from the Father and by the Spirit; and the Spirit works from the Father and from the Son, by himſelf; and the Father is the perſon ſending both the Son and the Spirit; and the Son is the perſon ſent from the Father, and ſending the Spirit with the Father; and the Spirit is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſent both from the Father and from the Son; but it will not follow that therefore Chriſt (though bodily abſent) is perſonally abſent from his Meſſengers, and inſtructs them not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately by himſelf, but onely by the Spirit: For as it is ſaid in <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 17. by Chriſt of the Father, <hi>My Father worketh hitherto and I work:</hi> The Father worketh all things by the Son; he made the world by the Son; and he judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgement to the Son; that is, by the Son he judgeth and manageth all things, and not without him; yet he worketh, that cannot be denied, though by the Son; yea the very works that the Son worketh, and all of them and none other but them, the Father
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48559:19"/> worketh; the Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father, and the Father and the Son are one in eſſence, though two in perſonality, and the Father and the Son work one thing; the Father by the Son, and the Son from the Father, and the Son can do nothing of himſelf apart from the Father, nor the Father any thing apart from the Son, but by him, as I have ſhewed at large in my former Treatiſe; ſo it may be ſaid of the Son and of the holy Ghoſt, that the Son worketh hitherto, and the holy Ghoſt worketh; that is, they work the ſame work, the Son by the holy Ghoſt, and the holy Ghoſt from the Son; and the holy Ghoſt ſhall not ſpeak of himſelf, nor act of himſelf (as ſaith the Scripture which he cites) that is, he ſhall not ſpeak or work any thing apart from the Son, but what he ſhall hear and ſee, that ſhall he ſpeak and do; and the Son doth ſpeak and act by him the ſame things, and nothing elſe; for the Son is in the holy Ghoſt, and the holy Ghoſt in the Son, and they are one in eſſence, and therefore cannot be divided in operation, but work the ſame things in ſuch an order of working, and to this the Scripture gives witneſs in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17. The Lord is called the Spirit, and the Spirit is called the Spirit of the Lord Chriſt; how can this be? Eſſentially the Lord Chriſt is the Spirit, they are one: Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally conſidered, the Spirit is the Spirit of the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48559:20"/> Lord Chriſt, and the Lord Chriſt is not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: And <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 1. to 6. compared with <hi>verſe</hi> 7. In <hi>verſe</hi> 1. to 6. Chriſt is the perſon that ſpeaks to the Church, and ſo to all the Churches, and commands <hi>John</hi> to write; but in <hi>verſe</hi> 7. it is ſaid, <hi>he that hath an ear to hear let him hear what the Spirit ſaith to the Churches;</hi> ſo that Chriſt ſpeaks, and yet the Spirit ſpeaks, and Chriſt and the Spirit are one in eſſence, though two in perſons; and Chriſt ſpake to the Churches by the Spirit, and the Spirit ſpake from Chriſt. But they act and work together the ſame things, and none other; as the Father and the Son do, ſo do the Son and Spirit, and indeed Father and Son and Spirit are one in eſſence, and one in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, the order of working onely excepted, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 7. ſo that Chriſts inſtructing by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, obſtructs not Chriſts perſonal preſence with the Diſciples here upon earth, though his body be in heaven. And the ſending of the Spirit both by the Father and by the Son, are acts of counſel among the perſons in the Godhead, as hath been fully declared in reference to Chriſt, who was ſent of the Father, and yet gave himſelf. And the Spirit though ſent, when he cometh acteth not meerly as one ſent, according to the will of another, but as himſelf willeth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 11. ſo that his ſending was by counſel with his own conſent.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:48559:20"/> 2. In the ſenſe that he aſſerts it, that Chriſt in Heaven acts by his Spirit, I ſhall utterly deny it, as that which both wants truth in it, and is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd; as that which is neither conſiſtent with Scripture nor reaſon, nor congruous to his own Opinion: for he takes away Chriſts immenſity, and ubiquity, and puts it upon the Spirit, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Chriſts being in Heaven and on Earth at once, and his filling of Heaven and Earth with his preſence, that he might not thereby be acknowledged God, and yet he makes the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to be univerſally preſent, and ſo makes him more then a creature, wherein he contradicts himſelf, for his words are theſe, <hi>Chriſt doth all theſe works in his abſence by his Spirit;</hi> therefore the Spirit is preſent, for he ſupplies the defect of Chriſts preſence, and yet withall he ſaith, <hi>The ſpirit which received of Chriſts was Chriſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument by which Jeſus Chriſt did the work:</hi> Therefore he is not God, for God cannot be an inſtrument, therefore he is but a creature; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he croſſeth himſelf. So then what muſt not be yielded to in Chriſt, leaſt he ſhould be God, he yields to the Spirit whom he makes not God, but a creature. And in this he not only ſets Chriſt below the Father, whom he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth to be God, but he ſets him below the Spirit, whom he acknowledgeth but a creature, and now Chriſt is neither God, nor yet the firſt
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48559:21"/> and chief of the creatures, for the Spirit is more excellent then he, for the Spirit can be preſent with all the Apoſtles in all the parts and Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mats of the World at one time, to inſtruct them, comfort them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Chriſt is ſhut up in Heaven and cannot. And this is contradictory to himſelf, for he makes Chriſt the firſt of the creatures, and the Maker of the reſt, and the Lord of them, and he makes him a Spirit in his firſt exiſtence, and yet the Spirit that was made by him can be with all the Apoſtles, and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and Saints alſo, and abide with them for ever, and adminiſter to them all good, but Chriſt who is his Lord and Maker cannot. O monſtrous and ſenſeleſs Opinion, wherein God leaves him to be confounded!</p>
               <p>But how contradictory to reaſon is this, that the Spirit ſhould be the inſtrument of Chriſt, and ſo a creature inferiour to Chriſt, and yet be preſent in all places in Heaven, in Earth, in the Sea, and every where, for where ever Saints be, there the Spirit is, &amp; Saints are in all theſe places, <hi>The Spirit is one that bears witneſs in Heaven,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 7. Therefore there he is, and he bears witneſs on Earth in the hearts of Believers, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 16. and therefore there he is. And the whole Spirit dwels in every Saint, for we do not read of any parts of the Spirit, into which he is divided, and if Saints be every
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48559:21"/> where, the whole Spirit is every where, and ſuch a boundleſs Eſſence is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent to any creature; it is that which God himſelf arrogates as proper to him, <hi>do not I fill Heaven and Earth? Jer.</hi> 23. 24. whole God fils every place, and the whole Spirit fils every Saint. As bodies have their <hi>loca,</hi> their places; ſo Spirits, all created ones, have their <hi>ubi,</hi> their ſome where, out of which and beyond which they are not; they are confined, if they be not circumſcribed; but of the Spirit it is ſaid, <hi>whither ſhall I go from thy Spirit, the Spirit is everywhere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is alſo extreamly repugnant to Scripture, that the Spirit ſhould be Chriſts inſtrument, and conſequently a creature, and it is as groſs as the denying of the Diety of Chriſt, and his Hereſie is multiplyed in this Aſſertion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. An Inſtrument acts and works after the will of the principal efficient, but the Spirit af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his own will as himſelf pleaſeth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no inſtrument.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The perſon by whom Chriſt wrought Miracles, was no inſtrument, but Chriſt accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his humane nature wrought Miracles by the vertue and power of the Spirit, therefore he was no inſtrument, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 28. <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 38.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He that was the uncture, with which Chriſt was annoynted and became more excellent and glorious then all his fellows; he that was the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48559:22"/> enrichment of Chriſt as man, as a creature, above all creatures, that exalted him in eminency above all Angels, &amp;c. was not any inſtrument inferiour to Chriſt, but ſuperiour to him as a creature, but the Spirit was the uncture wherewith Chriſt was annoynted, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 38. and he received not the Spirit by meaſure as others did, but beyond all meaſure, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 34. whence he came to excell all his fellows, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 9.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He that is the Spirit of God, and is to God as the ſpirit of a man is to man, he that alone knoweth the deep things of God and ſearcheth them; that is, hath deep full perfect knowledge of them, he cannot be an inſtrument to Chriſt, to take what Chriſt a creature, (as he makes Chriſt to be) ſhews him, and no more, and to ſhew them to men, but the Spirit is the Spirit of God, and ſtands to God as the Spirit of a man ſtands to man; and ſearcheth the deep things of God, therefore cannot be an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to take from Chriſt, and bring and ſhew to men. And it is contrary to Scripture to make the Spirit a creature, as if he be a creatures inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as he would make him) he muſt needs be.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He is called God by the Apoſtles of Chriſt, therefore he is God, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 3, 4. compared together, prove it: in the 3. ver. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith to <hi>Ananias, Thou haſt lyed to the holy Ghoſt;</hi> in the 4. verſ. he ſaith, <hi>Thou haſt lyed to God:</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:48559:22"/> He makes the holy Ghoſt to be God, for he ſhews the perſon againſt whom the ſin was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, it was not man, it was not any creature; it did riſe higher, it was the holy Ghoſt, he was God. So that the holy Ghoſt and God are one and the ſame thing. And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Paul</hi> makes him God, in theſe words, <hi>Know ye not that you are the temple of God, and that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God dwelleth in you?</hi> This latter is the proof of the former, becauſe the Spirit of God dwels in you, therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>you are the temple of God;</hi> here is no mention of Gods dwelling in them, but of the Spirits dwelling in them; if therefore the Spirit were not God, the Argument of the Apoſtle were nought. And by the Evangeliſt <hi>Luke</hi> in <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 3. 19, 20. compared together, he is called God: in verſ. 3. it is ſaid, <hi>The Angel of God came in to</hi> Cornelius, <hi>and commanded him to ſend men for Peter,</hi> in verſ. 19. 20. it is ſaid, <hi>That the Spirit told</hi> Peter <hi>that he had ſent thoſe men to him,</hi> and therefore he muſt go with them. The men were ſent upon the command of the Spirit, therefore the Spirit was that God that ſent the Angel, and to be the Angel of the Spirit, and the Angel of God is all one.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He is called the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 2, 3. compared together do confirm it: in verſ. 2. it is ſaid, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord ſpake by me, and</hi>

The Angel ſpeaks thus to <hi>Mary, The holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee, and the power of the Higheſt ſhall over ſhadow thee;</hi> This latter is but an enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the former, the ſame perſon is ſpoken of in both propoſitions, with this difference only; the name of the perſon ſpoken of, is put upon him in the former propoſition, <hi>viz</hi> the holy Ghoſt; the Title of the perſon is given to him in the latter; the Higheſt with his power ſhall
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48559:23"/> over-ſhadow thee, ſo that the holy Ghoſt is the higheſt. But ſome may object againſt this, and ſay, that the holy Ghoſt is not called the higheſt, but he is called the power of the Higheſt, or the vertue of the Higheſt, becauſe the Higheſt by the vertue of the holy Ghoſt would form Chriſt in the womb of the Virgin, or would cauſe her to conceive, &amp; ſo the holy Ghoſt and power are one thing, but not the holy Ghoſt and the Higheſt: If this were true, yet ſeeing a perſon is ſpoken of and not a thing, and this perſon is called the vertue or power of the Higheſt in ſo miraculous a work, he cannot be inferiour to the Higheſt; for he by whoſe force, and power, and vertue the higheſt ſhews himſelf to be the Higheſt, works as the Higheſt, muſt needs be as high as he, and if the Father ſhould be the Higheſt in this place, yet the holy Ghoſt is made equal to him, which ſhews the Father and the holy Ghoſt to be one in Eſſence, though two in perſonality, becauſe there can be but one Higheſt.</p>
               <p>But it appears to be otherwiſe, that Spirit and power are not confounded, but diſtinguiſhed, and there diſtinguiſhed where God is mentioned in <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 18, 19. <hi>God made the Gentiles obedient to the Goſpel, through mighty ſigns and wonders done by the power of the Spirit of God;</hi> here is pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and Spirit, and God, and all diſtinguiſhed
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48559:24"/> from other; by God, the Father is meant; by Spirit, the holy Ghoſt is meant; and by power, the vertue, might, and efficacy of the holy Ghoſt is meant; and it appears (which alone is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to prove holy Ghoſt to be God) that mighty ſigns and wonders were done by the proper power of the holy Ghoſt; it is not ſaid that they were done by the power of God, <hi>viz.</hi> the Father, but by the power of the Spirit of God, by the Spirits own proper power.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He is called God moſt high, and Almighty, all theſe titles are put upon the Spirit in <hi>Numb.</hi> 24. 2. 16. compared together: In <hi>verſe</hi> 2. it is ſaid of <hi>Balaam,</hi> that the Spirit of God came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; in <hi>verſe</hi> 16. <hi>Balaam</hi> deſcribes himſelf to be one that heard the words of God; that knew the knowledge of the moſt high, and ſaw the viſions of the Almighty, and all this was but the Spirit of God, which came upon him.</p>
               <p>I might ſpeak of the attributes of the Spirit, which are proper to the moſt high God, and prove him to be ſuch, as of Omnipotency, Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſciency, Omnipreſence, &amp;c. But he himſelf hath held forth theſe in his Letter, when he lived about <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> which in my former Treatiſe is printed to the view of the World, at which time his eyes were open, and he ſaw theſe attributes in the Spirit, and acknowledged the holy Ghoſt to be God upon the ſight thereof, though
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48559:24"/> his Faith had been ſuſpended before; but now he denies what he confeſſed then, and is left to blindneſs and darkneſs, and ſpeaks opprobriouſly of the Spirit of Grace, when he cals him the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of an inſtrument; for he makes Chriſt himſelf no more but the Fathers inſtrument and a creature; and the Spirit is no more but Chriſts inſtrument, and a creature of a creature. I ſhall now conclude with an Anſwer to what he cloſeth his Anſwers to this Text of <hi>Math.</hi> 28, with. He ſaith, this kinde of preſence by the Spirit, <hi>Beza</hi> and others underſtand to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 20.</p>

                  <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. Neither <hi>Beza</hi> nor any elſe ſave <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> do hold ſuch a kinde of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Spirit, as he hath held forth, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Spirit as an inſtrument by which Jeſus Chriſt did work, but only of the Spirit as God, and as the third perſon in the Trinity, equal with the Father &amp; with the Son, by whom the Father and Son do work, not as by an inſtrument, but as by an aſſociate, not as imparting any ſuperiority in them, or inferiority in the Spirit, but Order only, that they which are one in Eſſence but diſtinct in perſonality, might not be confounded (as they cannot be divided from one another) in operation; therefore as they are in one another, ſo they work from and by one another.</p>
               <p>2. The words which he mentions in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48559:25"/> as <hi>Bezaes</hi> upon the place, though I have diligently peruſed <hi>Beza,</hi> I cannot find neither in <hi>Matthew</hi> the Text that is controverted betwixt us; nor yet in any of thoſe Texts in <hi>John</hi> which ſpeak of the Spirit which he cites: neither would they be any whit advantageous to him, were they found in <hi>Beza;</hi> for they ſpeak of Chriſt as abſent in body, which none denies; but that whole Chriſt is abſent is not aſſerted, in the words; but the contrary ſeems to be implyed; for the abſence of Chriſt is limited to his body, <hi>Caeterum corpore abeſt,</hi> are the words, ſo that Chriſt may be preſent in that ſpirit of holineſs, which is his divine Nature, of which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 4. without any contradiction to <hi>Beza,</hi> if any ſuch words may be found in him.</p>
               <p>3. The words of <hi>Beza</hi> upon the place do dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer greatly from the words he preſents as his, and do not favour his expoſition at all, but may well be interpreted ſo as to cohere with the uſe I make of that Text, <hi>Cum autem idem ipſe domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus paulo ante dixerit, &amp;c.</hi> ſaith <hi>Beza;</hi> that is, <hi>When as the ſelf-ſame Lord Jeſus had ſaid a little before, Me you ſhall not have alwayes, and was to aſcend a little after; it is apparent that there muſt be a diſtinction, reſpecting the maner and way of Chriſts preſence and abſence; in body he is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but in vertue he is wholly moſt preſent; in which vertue he doth communicate himſelf, and all</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:48559:25"/> 
                  <hi>his things really in a ſpiritual way by faith unto us.</hi> Here is not one Word of the Spirit of God, but of the vertue and power of Chriſt in which he is preſent, which cannot be the vertue of his body, or of his Humane Nature in which he was ſo far abſent; for none of that could extend ſo far un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs conveyed by that which was preſent, <hi>viz.</hi> the divine Nature, which is preſent everywhere, and conveyes vertue from whole Chriſt to believers.</p>

               <p>What could he not? Is any thing too hard for the Lord?

                  <hi>Rep.</hi> When our Lord Jeſus Chriſt tels the Churches that he knows their works, his ſcope is not to diſcover to them what knowledge he had by revelation from the Father, but it was to make them ſenſible what quick ſharp piercing
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48559:26"/> eye-ſight he himſelf had, and what a vaſte in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible underſtanding and knowledge he had, for the comfort of all true Saints, and for the terror of all Hypocrites in all the Churches; and this is maniffeſt from 23. ver. of the ſame Chapter; &amp; had he but read the Chapter over, he would not have admired at me, <hi>viz.</hi> at my collection, but at his own Anſwers; <hi>I will kill her children</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>with death, and all the Churches ſhall know that I am he that ſearcheth the reines and hearts, &amp;c.</hi> In theſe words we may obſerve; firſt, what a knowledge it is that Chriſt hath of the works and wayes of the Church, and what it is he knows; it is an inward penetrating knowledge, it is of the moſt unſearchable parts, it is of the moſt hidden works, it is of the works of the hearts and reines of men. Secondly, how Chriſt came by this knowledge; not by any diſcovery that any other made to him, but by and from himſelf he hath this knowledge; it is a knowledge which he hath in himſelf it is his own knowledge, I ſearch the hearts and the reines. Thirdly, for what end Chriſt declares this his exquiſite and perfect knowledge of all things in man, which he hath in himſelf, that all the Churches may know who he was, what an one he was, more obſervant of all ſecret wickedneſs then they were aware of, that they might fear &amp; tremble more in reference to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48559:26"/> the eye of Chriſt, then they did before. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what this ſcience or knowledge of Chriſt doth denotate and demonſtrate Chriſt to be, no leſs then the moſt high God; for the moſt high God doth aſſume power and perfection of ſearching and trying hearts and reines to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as his own proper prerogative, which none is enabled to challenge; in <hi>Jer.</hi> 179 10. <hi>The heart is deceitful, and deſperately wicked, who can know it?</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, None can know it? But then he excepts himſelf, <hi>I the Lord ſearch the heart and try the reines;</hi> that is, I alone do it; and yet Chriſt attributes this high Divine tranſcendent knowledge to himſelf, and with ſuch ſuitable words, as if Chriſt were the perſon ſpeaking in <hi>Jeremie,</hi> or as if the perſon ſpeaking in <hi>Jeremie</hi> ſpake alſo in the Revelation, as if one and the ſame perſon ſpake in both places for they challenge one &amp; the ſame thing; &amp; the cloſe of the ſpeech in both places is the ſame, and it ſhews that one and the ſame God ſpeaks in both places, if not one and the ſame perſon. And now if Mr. <hi>Knowles</hi> have any ingenuity in him, he will open his eyes, and lie under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of this Text, unleſs he have ſold himſelf to be deluded, and to ſeduce others.</p>
               <p>It appears by what hath been preſented, that he cannot evade the ſtrength of this Text of <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 2. and the collection made there-from,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48559:27"/> with his inſtance of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> who knew what the King of <hi>Syria</hi> ſpake in his Bed-chamber, which was done, not by any wiſdome that was in him, but by the revelation of God; but Chriſts knowledge was not ſuch, was not from an other but from and in himſelf: But he reſts not in that, but flies to the Spirit, <hi>which</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>was given unto him beyond all meaſure,</hi> Joh. 3. 34. But what is this Spirit which was given to him, which made him thus wiſe, that he could know all the works of the Churches? This Spirit is in his opinion but a creature; he called him but very lately Chriſts inſtrument; and his whole ſcope in his Book is to ſhew that the Father a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is God, the moſt high God; therefore according to him the Spirit is but a creature: And ſhall Chriſt have all this help from a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to know all the works of the Churches? Doth the Spirit himſelf know all the hidden workings of the hearts of all Churches? and of all Saints? There are works of the hearts and reines; doth the Spirit know them, if he be but a creature? The Scripture tels us that none can know them but God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26. 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 139. 23. and <hi>Jer.</hi> 11. 20. <hi>&amp; Chap.</hi> 20. 12. But he ſaith the Spirit is not God, therefore cannot know ſuch things; therefore by the gift of him Chriſt cannot come to know ſuch things. And how comes the Spirit being but a creature to know more then
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48559:27"/> Chriſt, and to be Chriſts inſtructor, when Chriſt is the chief of all the creatures, and a God in wiſdom and ſtrength in compariſon of them according to his opinion? is not here an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency which doth always attend falſhood? Nor can the Spirit without meaſure be given to Chriſt, if the Spirit (as he aſſerts) be but a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for then himſelf is meaſured, being finite, and not infinite, and muſt be given in meaſure; therefore by the gift of him Chriſt cannot know all things. Yea, further it may be ſaid, though the Spirit were infinite, as indeed he is infinite, and is good (whatever he weakly and ſinfully aſſerts to the contrary) yet Chriſt being but a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (as he deſperately argues) he cannot be given without meaſure; for things are received according to the capacity of that which doth receive, and not above it; and ſo Chriſt being finite (as he holds) and meaſurable, doth ſtint and limit, and bring to a bound, and to a meaſure all that he receives; and indeed his humane nature that did receive the Spirit, being finite, was not capable of the Spirit without meaſure, though the Spirit himſelf be without meaſure; but it is an hyperbolical expreſſion, and the meaning is, Chriſt had aboundance of the Spirit, as he was man, beyond all men, and all creatures; but no finite proportion of the Spirit will enable Chriſt as man to know
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48559:28"/> by his own wiſdom that reſides in him, all the works of all the Churches; for none but the ſearcher of all hearts can do that, becauſe there are may hidden works of the heart: Now this Searcher of hearts is God only, therefore Chriſt is God.</p>
               <p>But he goes on and ſaith, <hi>Though Chriſt hath ſuch a knowledge, yet he is not the moſt high God, for his knowledge is of another,</hi> Joh. 5. 30. <hi>I can of mine own ſelf do nothing, as I hear I judge, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>Repl.</hi> I have already anſwered ſome parallel Scriptures to this in my former Treatiſe, <hi>pag.</hi> 145. to which I refer the Reader. I ſhall adde ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out of <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> and ſo paſs over it. <hi>I can do nothing of my ſelf,</hi> that is ſaith he, <hi>meo unius arbitratu, &amp; potentia, vel voluntate à patre ſeparata, cum una &amp; eadem ſit patris &amp; mea tum potentia, tum voluntas, ut &amp; eſſentia;</hi> that is, by my own ſingle proper power or will, ſeparate and apart from the Fathers, <hi>I can do nothing,</hi> when as my Fathers will and power, and mine are one and the ſame, even as the Eſſence is one. <hi>[As I hear.]</hi> The Fathers ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (ſaith he) and the Sons hearing do relate to one another; that is nothing but the Fathers giving community of vertue, and power, and of the very Eſſence it ſelf by generation from Eternity to the Son; and the Sons hearing is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the reception of it. Or, ſaith he, it
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48559:28"/> may reſpect the humane nature of Chriſt. Chriſt as man acts nothing, doth nothing apart from the will of his own Diety; for though the Divine will and the humane be two wils in number, yet they be not two but one in conſent and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo one with the Fathers will. And Chriſt as man, as he hears, that is, as the Father ſuggeſts to him, ſo he judgeth, which is true of the Divine will in Chriſt ſuggeſting to the humane. And <hi>Chemnitius</hi> in his Harmony, interprets the Sons not doing any thing of himſelf, to ariſe not out of the imbecillity of the Son, but from the abſolute and perfect identity of the Father and the Son in Eſſence, and all eſſential proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and acts; and the Sons hearing, he expounds to be the Sons knowing together with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all things decreed in the ſecret Counſel of the Divinty, or Divine Eſſence. And without doubt, the undivided operations of the Father and Son are pointed out. <hi>As I hear I judge,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, and in <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 15. <hi>I judge no man,</hi> and ver. 50. <hi>the Father ſeeketh and judgeth,</hi> and yet in <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 22 <hi>The Father judgeth no man, but hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted all judgement to the Son;</hi> Theſe Scriptures cannot be reconciled better then to ſay, they judge in one another, the Father in the Son, the Son in the Father, they act undividedly; the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is in Chriſt in all Chriſts operations, and the Son ſees and hears, and knows the Father, and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48559:29"/> the things of the Father in himſelf.</p>
               <p>He concludes his anſwer to this text of <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 2. thus, <hi>Though he alwayes knew all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the perfect diſcharge of his offices, yet there was a time when he was excluded from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the hour and day of judgement,</hi> Mark 13. 32. <hi>But of that day and hour no one knoweth, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Angels that are in heaven, nor the Son, unleſs the Father: Therefore his knowledge was not formally of himſelf, nor alwaies perfect.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> This text of <hi>Mark</hi> is to be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of Chriſt according to the humane nature, as he is the Son of man; for in that ſenſe he is alſo called the Son without any addition, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 28. compared with 23. for Chriſts manhood is there ſpoken of; for it is ſaid, Chriſt ſhould firſt riſe, which as man he onely doth; and then ver. 28. he is called the Son, which muſt refer to the ſame conſideration of Chriſt as man.</p>
               <p>And if it were otherwiſe, that <hi>Son</hi> were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies taken for Son of God, yet ſometimes a thing is ſpoken of in one nature, and muſt be underſtood in another. <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. it is called the bloud of God, but it is meant of the humane nature, becauſe conſidered as God, Chriſt hath not any bloud. And as the Son of man, is higher then the Angels, and knoweth more then the Angels, having a more excellent anointment then they; therefore the gradation is conſiſtent,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48559:29"/> and ſutable enough, neither the Angels nor the Son according to fleſh, which you will think more ſtrange, becauſe he is wiſer then the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>
               <p>And whereas he ſeems to limit it to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther onely, it muſt not be underſtood exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, as ſhutting out Chriſt as he is the Son of God from eternity, or as ſhutting out the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; for (firſt) if the words <gap reason="foreign">

It is inconſiſtent to what is aſſerted of Chriſts knowledge, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2. 3. it is ſaid that all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge are hid in him; how then ſhould he be ignorant of the day of judgement as he was the Son of God? And <hi>John</hi> 5. 20. the Father ſheweth the Son all things that himſelf doth, that is, in himſelf the Father ſhews all things; now this is one thing that the Father doth, he hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world; and this is ſhewed in Chriſts very eſſence, which is the ſame with his Fathers, and in Chriſts very will, which is the ſame with his Fathers, and Chriſt may read all the decrees of the Father in himſelf, in his own wiſdome and will: And he is called the wiſdome of the Father, and the admirable coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellour, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24. <hi>Eſay</hi> 9. 6. And the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples attributed to him the knowing of all things, <hi>John</hi> 16. 30. and <hi>John</hi> 21. 17. 4. It is inconſiſtent to the place which he cites, that Chriſt ſhould be abſolutely ignorant of the day and hour of judgement; to the context on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hand; for Chriſt had told all the forerunners of it, the things that ſhould precede, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that ſhould follow, the temper of men of that age when it ſhould be, the ſecurity that ſhould be in the world at that time; he himſelf was to be the perſon that muſt come as Judge, and he was to depart, and then to come, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48559:30"/> he was to appoint every one his work till he come, till the very day and hour of his coming, (the parable declares ſo much) and could he then be ignorant of the day and hour? it is againſt ſenſe and reaſon. Chriſt then had knowledge of the very preciſe time of judgement, and yet he had not knowledge, (he ſaith ſo himſelf) how is it to be underſtood? as he was the Son of man according to the man-hood he had not the knowledge thereof, but as he was the Son of God he had the knowledge thereof. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 15. was next produced by me, to prove the eternal generation of Chriſt by it; But he had perverted the true ſenſe of it before he came to it, and made uſe of it to ſerve his own purpoſe by it, while he was pleading for that unchriſt-like do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which he had received, and was ingaged to maintain it. And in this place he only tels me he had ſpoken to it, and with a ſcornful jeere prayes me to conſider it again, and by my next to let him hear what part thereof it is in which Chriſts eternal generation may be ſeen.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <p>I ſhall now come to the conſideration of <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>By him were all things created, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>John</hi> 1. 3. <hi>All things were made by him, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him was made nothing that was made:</hi> In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to which he thinks he hath acted his part gallantly; but let us hear what it is that he ſaith.</p>
               <p>He puts the Scriptures into an argument, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48559:32"/> this ſort, <hi>He by whom all things were made, is the moſt high God; but all things were made by Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> therefore Jeſus Chriſt is the moſt high God.</p>
               <p>He grants the major in reference to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal agent, but denies it in reference to an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental agent: And ſaith he aſſerts Jeſus Chriſt to be onely an inſtrumental agent in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> I have already in many places of my other Treatiſe (becauſe he often harps upon Chriſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentalneſſe to the Father, in creating all things) confuted this aſſertion; yet if he have any thing to ſay in the defence of it, I am willing to diſcuſſe it with him. And he produceth four reaſons for the confirming of his poſition. I ſhall try the ſtrength of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The book of the creatures ſpeaks onely of one firſt cauſe, and principal agent of all things; of a Trinity of perſons, in unity of eſſence, as principal agents in the work of creation, the whole creation is ſilent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. If the book of the creatures were wholly ſilent: yet if the book of the Scriptures be not ſilent, we are to attend the book of the Scriptures; if the book of the creatures would have taught us all things that we ought to believe concerning God, what need had there been of the book of the Scriptures?</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:48559:32"/> 2 The book of the creatures doth teach many things which we underſtand not from them; the defect is in us, not in it: we are dul in apprehending, and <hi>ſlow of heart in beleeving</hi> what the book of the Scriptures doth teach us, therefore may not conceive aright what the book of the Creatures doth teach us.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The heathen Philoſophers from the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Reaſon have acknowledged a Trinity of Perſons in the unity of Eſſence; as <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus</hi> a French Lord, in that exquiſite piece of his, called <hi>The trueneſſe of Christian Religion,</hi> largely and ſatisfactorily ſhews, if the Reader will be at the pains to peruſe him.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The inanimate creatures have ſome kind of impreſſion of the Trinity upon them; and <hi>one</hi> God in <hi>three</hi> Perſons hath in a kind left his image and his reſemblance upon them: The <hi>Sun</hi> begets <hi>beams</hi> and <hi>rayes,</hi> and from both theſe proceeds <hi>light;</hi> and yet neither is the <hi>Sun</hi> before the <hi>beams,</hi> nor the <hi>beams</hi> before the <hi>light</hi> that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from them, but in order onely and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo far as the beams are begotten, and the light proceeds; but not in time: which doth adumbrate the coeternity of the Three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. So alſo there is the Fountain, and there is the water that bubbles up, which is (as it were) begotten of the Fountain; and there is the ſtream that proceeds from both; and theſe are at once in time: for in the firſt moment
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48559:33"/> that there is a fountain, there is the bubling of water, or the riſing up, or boyling of it; and no ſooner is the bubling, but there is an iſſuing or proceeding of water, the water runs from it, if there be paſſage: and yet in order the fountain is firſt, the bubling is next, and the proceeding of water is laſt, but they are together in time; And may it not be ſaid that the impreſſion of the Trinity is here? but the character in which the Trinity is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the book of the creatures, is ſmaller and darker then that every one can read; when yet things of the God-head, ſome of them may more eaſily be ſpelled forth.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Though we affirm that the Father creates, and the Son creates, and the Holy Ghoſt cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates, and that theſe three are three perſons, yet we do not hold that theſe three are three reall diſtinct Agents, but one Agent. For they are all of them but one thing, &amp; but one God; and ſo really but one Agent; but this one A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſubſiſts divers ways in three perſons, as one God ſubſiſts divers ways in three perſons, and theſe perſons are not another thing from that one God, and ſo not another thing from that one Agent. So that he goes upon a miſtake, while he diſputes againſt three principall A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents. As ſuppoſe there were one ſoul in three bodies, moving them alike in all operations, and acting by them; theſe three bodies would
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48559:33"/> not be three Agents, but one Agent, though all the bodies perform the work. And if there be one God in three perſons, (or which is all one) ſubſiſting three manner of ways, yet the three manner of ways of ſubſiſting, doth not make three Gods, nor three Agents. But there is no ſimilitude that will rightly and exactly, and fully in all things hold forth the working of God in trinity of perſons; only ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle crevice of light may be opened, to give a little inſight into this truth.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Our Divines when they have confeſſed that God is known by the Creation, but have denyed that God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt are known thereby; they have meant it of a demonſtrative knowledge which of God men may arrive at; but of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity they cannot; yet there may be ſome things that may ſhadow it out, though very darkly.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It is certain, that that which is clearly ſeen of God in the Creation, belongs to his Eſſence. For the Apoſtle tels us ſo much, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>his Godhead is ſeen, things belonging to his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi> viz. <hi>his power, his wiſdome, the liberty of his will, his goodneſſe, holineſſe;</hi> and many more properties belonging to his Eſſence, which are common to all the perſons; but thoſe ſubſiſtantiall, perſonall properties, they are not by any viſible characters to be diſcern'd.</p>
               <p>But he objects againſt our Divines, for
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48559:34"/> ſaying, God is known from the Creation, but not Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; and he objects againſt the reaſon that they render, viz. <hi>That the efficient force and vertue by which the world was created, belongs to the Eſſence of God, and not to the perſonall ſubſiſtence;</hi> his words are theſe,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yet by their leave, God is a Perſon, all acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being proper unto perſons, therefore by their grant, the work of creation holds forth but one Agent: for it is not imaginable, that if there were more then one principall Agent, they ſhould not all be equally diſcovered by the work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> I have anſwered unto this, Gods being a Perſon, and have declared that God rather imports eſſentiality, then perſonality; yet withall, I have ſhewed that eſſence is never ſeparated from perſon, but ſubſiſts in it; and if God be properly ſpoken of, there the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is meant, as it ſubſiſts in three perſons, in Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Yet when it reſpects acting things without them, theſe three perſons act in that which is common to them all, and wherein they are in one, and not wherein they are diſtinguiſhed, and are three; they act by the ſame eſſentiall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, as power, wiſdome, &amp;c. and theſe are one and the ſame in them all, and ſo it is Gods work in Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48559:34"/> and not the Fathers work alone and apart, nor God the Sons work alone and apart, nor God the Holy Ghoſt's work alone and apart, nor yet the work of all theſe wherein they differ, and are three diſtinct from each other, but the work of all as they are one. And the Father is no more diſcovered then the Son, nor any one more then other, but God in all is diſcovered. So that he is upon a miſtake when he ſpeaks of three principall Agents, that muſt be diſcovered in the work of creation. For theſe perſons that are, work but one thing, one being, one God, one reall Agent; for the very thing that the Father acts, the Son acts, and the Holy Ghoſt acts, and the power is one, and the wiſdome is one, and the act is one.</p>
               <p>Or ſuppoſe it were granted, that there are three principall Agents, yet there are not three Agents eſſentially diſtinct, but perſonally on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and ſo it comes all to one, whether one ſay that there are three Agents, that may be called principall; or whether one ſay, there is one principall Agent: for the one Agent is in three perſons, and acts with ſome perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall diverſity, and the three Agents are but one in eſſence, and but one thing, and act one thing, and by one power; therefore it is not materiall how it is expreſſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Agent,</hi> as it relates. to God, may admit of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48559:35"/> the ſame diſtinction as is made when we ſpeak of God: <hi>Agent</hi> is conſidered either <hi>eſſentially,</hi> or <hi>ſubſiſtentially: Eſſentially,</hi> and then there is but one, as there is but one God. <hi>Subſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially,</hi> and then there are three, as there are three Perſons: But they do not differ really and eſſentially one from another, as the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons do not; but onely in the manner of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Agent</hi> taken perſonally, though they ſhould be three, yet need not be diſcovered each of them in the work, becauſe as they are eſſentially one, ſo they work one individuall work by one individuall power, and force, and efficacy, which is numerically the ſame, and therefore cannot leave a diſtinct impreſſion in any work.</p>
               <p>His ſecond Argument by which he would prove Chriſt to be but an inſtrumental Agent in creating the world, is fetch'd from Reaſon: his words are theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſecond reaſon proceeds from the verdict of pure Reaſon: If Reaſon may obtain credit, ſhe will tell us, that there could be in the work of Creation but one principall agent, becauſe there is by nature but one God; for if there were two principall agents, there muſt be two Gods, the terms being convertible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> 1. There is neither <hi>pure</hi> Reaſon nor <hi>cleer</hi> Reaſon to be found among men; and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48559:35"/> while he pleads ſo earneſtly for Reaſon, he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth himſelf and the Truth in corrupted and darkened Reaſon, which he too much follows; and being in purſuit after Reaſon what it will preſent, he turns aſide from Scripture, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains not the knowledg of the Truth, which he would ſeem to contend for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> 2. He argues from plurality of Agents in the Creation, to plurality of Gods: which would have force and ſtrength in it, if we held plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Agents really and eſſentially diſtinct from one another: but if the Agent be one in eſſence, and perſonally onely more then one, (which is the doctrine we hold) no ſuch ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd conſequence will follow, that there ſhould be two or more Gods, becauſe there are two or more Agents perſonally (but not eſſentially) differing from one another.</p>
               <p>3. His third Reaſon <hi>iſſues from the nature of Chriſts being. Chriſt is the image of the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible God, and ſo is diſtinguiſhed from God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the image and the thing whereof it is an image is not the ſame, in that nothing can be the image of it ſelf.</hi> Col. 1. 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> Where it is ſaid, that Chriſt is the <hi>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God,</hi> God is there taken Synechdochi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, or perſonally for the <hi>Father,</hi> as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if you compare it with <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. where he is called <hi>the expreſs image of his Fathers perſon.</hi> Now Chriſt may be the image of the Father,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48559:36"/> and yet not the image of himſelf; for though God, taken eſſentially, do not differ from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and therefore he cannot in that ſenſe be the image of God, and be God himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſhould then be the image of himſelf; yet God taken perſonally for the Father, may differ from himſelf, taken perſonally for the Son; that is, one perſon may, doth differ from another, and one may be the image of another, the Son of the Father; and may in that ſenſe be the image of God, and yet not of himſelf, though he be God.</p>
               <p>But he renders a reaſon why Chriſt is called the image of God. <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>God did manifeſt his divine glory and dominion over the creature through him chiefly, for which reaſon alſo man is called the image and glory of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> Chriſt according to his manhood may be called the image of God, becauſe of that glory and dominion that he was lifted up to, for he was made head of all principality and power; but he was the image of God in an higher way alſo: <hi>viz. as he was a Son, Heb.</hi> 1. 2. 3. which Sonſhip was before this colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Lordſhip, which he had; for he was a Son before there was any creature to rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as himſelf hath confeſſed; and if a Son, then the image of his Father: but this was diſcuſſed in my former Treat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48559:36"/> I might have paſſed it over in ſilence.</p>
               <p>He ſaith further, that <hi>Chriſt is called the firſt-born of every creature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> The urging and the anſwering of this is but to weary the Reader with frivolous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions; therefore I referre him to what hath been repreſented already, both in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and in this preſent Treatiſe, concerning this Title, <hi>Firſt-born of every creature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude, The force of this argument lies in this; whole Chriſt is a creature, and therefore but an inſtrumental Agent, &amp; to prove the Antecedent, he produceth, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 15. produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced before. He might have cited &amp; rehearſed all thoſe Arguments, &amp; Scriptures of his which he brought before, &amp; wherewith he filled many pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as aptly &amp; fitly as he hath mentioned theſe, but with little profit or delight to the Reader.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude my anſwer to this argument, that when ever he ſhall be able to prove Chriſt to be a creature, I will yeild him to be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall Agent. But then it muſt be done with repetitions.</p>
               <p>I now come to anſwer his fourth reaſon, which (he ſaith) <hi>doth ſpring from the manner of Chriſt's working, ſaith he, though Chriſt had an hand in the Creation of the world, yet was it not originally of him.</hi> 1 Cor. 8. 6. <hi>All things are of the Father, but not of, but by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; the Father is made the firſt cauſe,</hi>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:48559:37"/> 
                  <hi>and originall of all things, and Chriſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of the Father,</hi> 2. <hi>In that it is ſaid in Scripture, that God acted by him in the work of creation,</hi> Epheſ. 3. 9. <hi>where it is ſaid, that God created all things by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſo in Heb. 1. 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> I find no new ſtrength of argument here, but what I have met with before, &amp; have largely anſwered before, in that former Treatiſe of mine; to which I referre the Reader; for I am aſhamed to follow him in his cauſleſſe iterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and repetitions, yet I ſhall add ſomething to what I have repreſented, ſeeing he gives me an occaſion.</p>
               <p>As there is a diſtinct order of ſubſiſting, ſo there is a diſtinct order of working. And the divine eſſence ſubſiſting in three perſons, theſe perſons work in three diſtinct manners; the Son being begotten of the Father, worketh from the Father, <hi>The Son can do nothing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but what he ſeeth the Father do,</hi> John 5. 19. And the Father begetting the Son, worketh by the Son, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 16. 20. and in very many more places. So the Holy Ghoſt proceeding from the Father, and from the Son, worketh from them both, in <hi>John</hi> 16. 13. <hi>He ſhall not ſpeak of himſelfe, but as he hears ſo ſhall he ſpeak, and he ſhall take of mine, and ſhew unto you;</hi> yet neither the Son, nor the Holy Ghoſt do work as inſtruments.</p>
               <p>The Son doth not, for that is the ſubject in hand
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48559:37"/> to be diſcuſſed, nor doth the Greek particle <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, (which is here tranſlated <hi>by)</hi> ſhew ſo much; for it is prefixed to the works of the Father, as well as to the works of the Son, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Paul an Apoſtle, not of men, nor by men, but by Jeſus Chriſt, and God the Father.</hi> Here we may obſerve three things, 1. That theſe particles, or prepoſitions are not always di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing particles, putting difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt thing and thing, to which they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed; but they many times are promiſcuouſly uſed, and are confounded; for <hi>[of</hi> and <hi>by</hi>] applied to men, do import the ſame thing. 2. The particle <hi>by,</hi> doth not declare the perſon to whom it is applied to be an inſtrument; for it is applied to the Father equally as to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. But he will not aſſert the Father to be an inſtrument. 3. That whereas the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son are mentioned together, they are made equall in manner of working, and they are either both inſtruments, or both prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Agents, and Efficients; for <hi>Paul</hi> was an Apoſtle by Jeſus Chriſt, and by God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Jeſus Chriſt hath the leading place. In <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 36. <hi>For of him, and by him, and to him are all things.</hi> Here the particle <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is tranſlated <hi>by,</hi> or <hi>through,</hi> is attributed to God, and he will ſay, that the Father is meant, and only the Father; and we may obſerve two things. 1. According to the truth of the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48559:38"/> thing, the particles <hi>of</hi> and <hi>by</hi> are all one; and that <hi>by</hi> doth not import any inſtrumentalneſs; for God in no ſenſe can be an inſtrument. 2. According to the ſenſe that he puts upon the particle <hi>by,</hi> God is both the principall Agent, becauſe <hi>of him are all things:</hi> and he is alſo the Inſtrument of all things, for <hi>by him are all things.</hi> Alſo in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 10. where the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is ſpoken of and attributed to the Father, and not to the Son, it is not attributed to him as ſomething <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but as ſomthing <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, not as <hi>of him,</hi> but as <hi>by him:</hi> The words are theſe, <hi>It behoved him for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, to make the Prince and Captain,</hi> &amp;c. Yet he will not ſay that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is an Inſtrument. I ſhall not multiply places, theſe Texts are ſufficient to ſhew the abſurdity and falſeneſs of the gloſs that he puts upon the prepoſitions <hi>[of]</hi> and <hi>[by].</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which he aſſerts of the Fathers, that they frequently call him Gods inſtrument, and ſervant, is true of Chriſt as the ſon of man, according to his humane nature; and they call him no other then the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 1. which muſt he ſo underſtood.</p>
               <p>In the next place, after his Arguments, where he placed his own ſtrength for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Chriſts inſtrumentalneſs in <hi>Creation,</hi> he comes to conſider my Argument againſt it, which was this:</p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:48559:38"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>God could not make uſe of an instrument in the work of creating of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this he anſwers, 1. <hi>This Aſſertion derogates from Gods al-ſufficiency: Is any thing impoſſible with God? is any thing too hard for the Lord?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> This Aſſertion, as it is laid down, with a reaſon to explain it, is ſo far from derogating from Gods al-ſufficiency, that it is the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of Gods al-ſufficiency: there is ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity of perfection in Gods al-ſufficiency, that it is incommunicable to the creature: God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make another as ſufficient as himſelf; that is, It is ſo tranſcendently excellent, that no creature is capable of it. And whereas he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, Is any thing too hard for God? Is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing impoſſible to the Lord? he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this anſwer, What-ever may be done by power, God can do it, becauſe he hath ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of power in himſelf to do it: But that which cannot be done in the nature of the thing, which implyes a contradiction if it were ſuppoſed to be done, that is impoſſible with God, or in it ſelf rather: as, It is impoſſible for the moſt high God to make a God moſt high, becauſe God moſt high hath his being of himſelf, and is uncreated and eternall, and gives being to other things. Therefore a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted moſt high God carries a contradiction with it, therefore is a thing not to be done, and God cannot do it; yet it argues not any
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48559:39"/> weakneſs in God becauſe he cannot do it.</p>
               <p>2. He ſaith I contradict my own teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and he minds me of the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I remember</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that in a Conference (where I exerciſed both ſilence and patience, to the glory of God) ſince I received your paper, you did affirm (in the hearing of not a few) that God might have made an Angel, or ſome other creature at the firſt, and by it have made all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> I do remember that time he ſpeaks of, and ſo do ſome ſcores of perſons as well as I, &amp; will remember it while they live, wherein he exerciſed not ſilence altogether, for he ſpake at the laſt in the cloſe of the conference, &amp; it had been better he had been ſilent, then to ſpeak as he did, for he aſſerted an untruth in thoſe few words he did ſpeak: he uttered words to this purpoſe, That it was ſtrange to him, that he ſhould be brought upon the ſtage in ſo publick a way, for holding ſuch an opinion, when he had not declared himſelf in a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive way at any time about it: Which cauſed me to mind him of his firſt Sermon in which he broached his opinion in a poſitive way, in this aſſertion, <hi>That Christ is not the ultimate and last rest of Saints, but the Father; and that Christ was but the way to it.</hi> Which, if Chriſt be coeſſentiall with the Father, is falſe; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his aſſertion did deny by an undenyable
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48559:39"/> conſequence the coeſſentiality of Chriſt with the Father. And at another time he publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his preaching ſpeaking his opinion on <hi>John</hi> 3. 13. <hi>No man hath aſcended up into heaven but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven,</hi> ſaid, that he could not conceive how Chriſt being at that time on earth, could be in heaven, unleſſe it were in reſpect of that knowledg which he had of the Father, and the things of heaven: or words to this effect. In which he denyed the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſence of Chriſt, and conſequently the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of Chriſt: And yet in that ſhort ſpeech of his he would make fair weather of it, and put a face upon it, as if he were not the man he was taken for.</p>
               <p>Concerning his <hi>patience,</hi> not I alone, but many others did judge it ſtupidity rather then patience; for ſcarce any one that had had the ſpirit of a man, could have been dumb, and not open his mouth, when he was ſo palpably called forth to appear in the cauſe. It did cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſtrike amazement in very many, that knew he was there, and yet could not hear him ſpeak one word, having ſo many ſtrong invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereto; Or if it were not ſtupidity, it was cunning craftineſs; for he knew how to make advantage by being here and keeping ſilence, and he could reſerve himſelf in point of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to a more hopefull time, and fairer op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48559:40"/> in which he might by ſpeaking propagate his opinion; there was little hope of advantaging his cauſe at that time, when there were ſo many to contradict him. And yet he might feele mens pulſes by being there, and diſcern who were his friends, and who his enemies, and who might probably be wrought upon, and who not.</p>
               <p>But (he ſaith) <hi>it was to the glory of God, that he exerciſed ſilence and patience.</hi> But it was every to way the diſhonor of God, for if truth were in his tenent, then he ſhamefully deſerted it, when he ſhould have committed himſelf to God in the maintaining of it, who ever oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it. And if Errour and Hereſie were in his tenent, then he carried it craftily to do the more miſchiefe, for he thought it wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to forbear when it might be much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and to take time to ſpeak, when it might be more prevalent, that he might draw away the more Diſciples after him.</p>
               <p>But he tells me of a contradiction. Where lies it? In theſe words, <hi>God could make uſe of no Inſtrument in the worke of creation; and God might have made uſe of an Angel, or ſome other creature, and by it have made all things.</hi> Here is a contradiction indeed, if theſe aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be taken ſeparately, from other expre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that expounded them. And here lies the injury that he doth me, which an unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48559:40"/> perſon, and ſtander by betwixt us, upon his firſt reading of this charge which he makes againſt me, of contradiction, (who was preſent at the conference) ſoone diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and expreſſed himſelfe to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>That he ſhould thinke the worſe of Mr.</hi> Knowles <hi>while he knew him, for the wrong he did me in this matter.</hi> He leaves out thoſe words which cleared it from contradiction; When I ſaid, <hi>God could uſe no inſtrument in the worke of creation,</hi> I ſpoke of ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument by whoſe force, and vertue, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſuch a worke might be affected, as my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter words clearly ſhew; <hi>becauſe creation is the making of things out of nothing, and required an infinite power, which no creature is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, for it would make him a God.</hi> Theſe words do demonſtrate that I ſpake of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument that might be co-operative with God in vertue and efficacy in ſo great a worke. But when I ſpake of <hi>an Angell as an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which God might have made uſe of in the creation of the world, if he would,</hi> I both meant it, and expreſſed it of ſuch a kind of Inſtrument which contributes no vertue nor efficacy to the worke, but is a means without which God will not do ſuch a worke, rather then a means by which he will do it; ſuch as the blowing with rams horns was for the bringing downe of the walls
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48559:41"/> of <hi>Jericho,</hi> in which there was no vertue for the effecting of ſuch a worke, and ſo God might have made an Angell, and might have ſaid to it, Go, ſay, Let there be Heavens and earth, and at the Angels ſpeaking, it might have been; not becauſe there was any vertue in the Angels ſpeaking for the production of ſuch things; but the vertue is wholly Gods. But it is otherwiſe with Chriſt in his making of the World, the vertue is his owne, Chriſt is ſaid to <hi>ſupport al things by the word of his own power,</hi> and ſo by conſequence to create all things by the word of his owne power. Now ſuch an Inſtrument Chriſt could not be, nor any creature, nor could any creature be capable of any ſuch power: and thus I expreſſed it upon that day of conference, as there are many witneſſes. And yet thus he abuſeth me, and then gloryes over me in a large man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and triumphs exceſſively. His words are theſe:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How to reconcile one with another is unfea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, you muſt confeſs you are not alwayes infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, you ſometimes differ from your ſelfe, and then no wonder if you diſagree with others. What ſhall I take for your judgment,</hi> &amp;c?</p>
               <p>And thus he goes on in a vapouring way, with a deal of ſtuff ſuch as this, and his glorying over me in this, (ſeeing I am innocent where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he accuſeth me) is not my ſhame, but his.</p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:48559:41"/>
               <p> Afterwards, when he had teſtified his high eſtimation of reaſon in ſome hyperbolicall, or rather phantaſticall expreſſions, <hi>as proſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelfe to the ſhadow of it, rather then to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mans teſtimony,</hi> (if he had ſpoken ſo much of Scripture, I ſhould have liked it better) he examines my reaſon, why God could make uſe of no Inſtrument in creation of the world.</p>
               <p>My reaſon was this, Creation is a making all things out of nothing, and requires an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite power, which God cannot derive to any creature; and therefore he cannot make uſe of any Inſtrument in creating.</p>
               <p>His firſt anſwer that he gives is this, <hi>That Gods infinite power was manifeſted in the worke of creation, yet was not the infinity of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er manifeſted fully in that, or any other worke; for he hath more power then ever yet he had need to uſe, or then could in any worke be fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> In this anſwer there ſeems to be 1. <hi>abſurdity,</hi> 2. <hi>Impertinency,</hi> 3. <hi>Evaſion.</hi> The <hi>abſurdity</hi> is in this, there is a diſtinction put without a difference appearing: he would make infinite power manifeſted, and infinity of power manifeſted, to be two things, and yet they are the ſame thing; for infinite power and infinity of power are both one thing, and infinite power manifeſted, and infinity of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48559:42"/> power manifeſted muſt conſequently be one thing alſo. The <hi>impertinence</hi> lies in this; My Argument runs of one thing, his anſwer is to another thing; I ſpeake of infinite power derived to the creature, and ſay the creature is not capable of it; he tels me of infinite power manifeſted, and ſo ſpeaks not to the purpoſe. The <hi>evaſion</hi> appears in this, he ſaith that the infinity of Gods power was not manifeſted fully in that work of creation, or in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but what of this? If it was not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifeſted, yet was it not truely mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted? ſo as that the rationall creature might be able to ſay, the power that was put forth in making ſuch creatures of nothing, is infinite, no leſs then the power of the moſt high God? as ſometimes the Magicians of <hi>Egypt</hi> ſaid, this is the finger of God, the power of God, which tranſcends the power that any creature is capable of. And if infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite power was truly manifeſted, how is the Argument enervated, or wherein invalidated? And if infinity of power be not fully manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, what is the reaſon of it? Doth it not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a contradiction in the ſenſe in which he intends it? For to aſſert that infinity of power is in ſuch ſort manifeſted in any work, as that he cannot further manifeſt it, but hath wrought to the utmoſt of his power, and can proceed no further, neither hath any more to uſe, is
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48559:42"/> to deny infinity of power to be in God; and there is a contradiction in it <hi>in adjecto,</hi> a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction implied; and ſuch a manifeſtation would rather be an exhauſtion of power, which is impoſſible where infinite power is.</p>
               <p>His expreſſions of more power in thoſe words of his, <hi>he hath more power then ever yet he had need to uſe,</hi> have truth in them in a ſenſe, but in an other ſenſe have fraud and falſhood in them; if he mean by more power, more of the ſame kind then ever yet he had need to uſe, it will be granted to him, without any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to him; for if God could ſpend his ſtore, he could not be ſaid to be infinite in power. It is certain, that God hath an inexhauſtable treaſure of power, and the more he manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth of it, he hath not the leſs to manifeſt, but can declare it millions of waies in which he hath not yet declared it; and there may be yet more glorious effects of it if he ſhall pleaſe, then any that have been wrought. But this conceſſion hurts not my aſſertion, viz <hi>that an infinite power is required in creation;</hi> and he hath not denyed the truth and clearneſs of the manifeſtation of it therein, though he ſay there may by a fuller manifeſtation of it, which by the multiplication of mighty works which God can effect, muſt needs be; becauſe every work will bear witneſs thereof in reference to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48559:43"/> it ſelf. But if he ſhould mean by <hi>more power</hi> a greater power, or more in meaſure, and degree then yet he hath uſed and manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in the creation, and in the works which he hath wrought, it muſt not be yeilded to him; for though there might be a greater work, yet not a greater power, for the ſame power is manifeſted in the one as in the other, <hi>viz.</hi> an infinite power, and there are no degrees in that which is infinite; though one worke may more fully ſpeak to us that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity of power which is put forth therein then an other doth.</p>
               <p>The work of creation is that work that God glories in in the Scripture, and he doth appropriate it to himſelf, and doth give witneſs therein to the world, that he is the moſt high God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. 10, 11, 12. <hi>And the inviſible things of him from the creation of the world are cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeen, being underſtood by the the things that are made, even his eternall power and Godhead, ſo that the very heathen are left without excuſe,</hi> Rom. 1. 20.</p>
               <p>And a greater work then creation is, from which an ampler teſtimony of the infinity of Gods power may be fetched for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the creature, in ſome ſenſe there can be none; for there is an infinite diſtance betwixt ſomething and nothing, and onely an infinite power can get over it: for that which
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48559:43"/> cannot be meaſured is infinite, but the diſtance betwixt ſomething and nothing is ſuch as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be meaſured; and creation is a bringing of ſomething out of nothing, therefore the power that effects it muſt be infinite: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore infinite power or infinity of power is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in great fulneſſe and cleareneſſe in creation.</p>
               <p>His 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. anſwer that he gives is this,</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Your aſſertion plainly denyes the man Chriſt Jeſus to be God Almighty, or infinite in power; for you ſay, that God could not give or derive an infinite power to any creature, and that a creature cannot be God Almighty, &amp;c. The man Chriſt Jeſus was a creature, How then can that perſon be God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> This reaſoning is unworthy a man of parts; a very child that hath learned the firſt principles, might anſwer him. The man Chriſt Jeſus is a creature; that is, the ſon of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> is a creature; and I do deny this ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to be God, or Almighty, or capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of an infinite power, and therfore God could not derive it, nor was Chriſt Almighty as man, as the ſon of man; But this man Chriſt Jeſus was God, as well as man, that is, this perſon Chriſt Jeſus, was both God and man; not that the manhood was turned into the Godhead, and ſo became God, but that the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48559:44"/> eternall Son of God, who is by nature God, with the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med manhood, tooke the nature of man, the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and became one perſon with it, and this perſon was Almighty, as he was the Son of God, not as man; and this almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe was not by derivation from the Father, but was an eſſentiall attribute in him.</p>
               <p>His third Argument is this,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Ground (ſaith he) of your Argument is ſtraw and ſtubble; for infinite power may be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted by them to whom 'tis not communicated. And he gives inſtances many.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> Becauſe I ſoreſaw he might give ſuch an anſwer, therefore on that day of the conference, which he ſpoke of, I mentioned ſuch an inſtrument which he now ſpeaks of, which is not the ſubject of the power, but a meanes without which God will not exerciſe the power which he himſelfe is the ſubject of: and I granted, God might have made uſe of ſuch an inſtrument, but Chriſt in creation (as alſo in preſervation) is the ſubject of the power, and I ſpoke of ſuch an inſtrument which is the ſubject of power, and ſhewed it was impoſſible that there ſhould be ſuch an inſtrument, and therefore Chriſt having ſuch power in himſelfe could not be an inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, but the principall Agent.</p>
               <p>He comes in the laſt place to conſider of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48559:44"/> the Minor of the Argument, which he had caſt the Scriptures I produced into, fetched from Chriſts creating, which is this: <hi>All things were made by Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His anſwer is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is true, Chriſt being excepted, of whoſe creaturall being</hi> I have already ſpoken.</p>
               <p>But againſt this anſwer he frames an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>You will ſay</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that in Joh.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>it is ſaid, that without him was nothing made that was made.</hi> And he anſwers it,</p>
               <p>Sol. <hi>The words are to be restrained to all thoſe things which by the uſe of an instrument were made; in the firſt verſe the creation of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is included, and in this</hi> 3 <hi>verſe he is ſpoken of as the inſtrument of God in creating all things; therefore he is there to be excepted.</hi> And he gives ſome inſtances, which I omit the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of, becauſe I ſhall have no need to return anſwer to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> If indeed the creation of Jeſus Chriſt be included in <hi>ver.</hi> 1. then I ſhall grant that Jeſus Chriſt is excepted in <hi>ver.</hi> 3. but if not, then <hi>ver.</hi> 3. is ſtrong againſt him. The words in <hi>ver</hi> 1. <hi>In the beginning was the word,</hi> and that is granted by both ſides, that then he <hi>was;</hi> but that then he <hi>began</hi> is not aſſerted by the Apoſtle and is denyed by us: if he will have it to be ſo, let him ſhew in his next how he
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48559:45"/> will fetch out creation from theſe words, <hi>In the beginning was the word.</hi> God the Father was in the beginning; was God the Father therefore created in the beginning?</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <p>The next Scripture produced by me to prove Chriſt's Deity by, was <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 3. <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out father, without mother, without deſcent, having neither beginning of dayes, nor end of life, made like unto the Son of God, abideth a Prieſt continually.</hi> Chriſt is here reſembled to <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> in reference to eternity. But what anſwer makes he to this text! Truly it is an impotent, lame, and poor anſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Was Melchiſedech</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>eternall? if ſo, then he was God, but he was neither the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor the Son, nor the Holy Ghoſt; I hope you will not allow a quaternity of perſons in unity of eſſence; and therefore will allow the words to be taken in a figurative ſenſe; Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech was without beginning of dayes, and end of life, in that there is no mention made either of his birth or death in the Hiſtory of Moſes, or eſpecially in reference to his Prieſthood; the time of it's beginning or ending, being not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly known. So our High Prieſt Jeſus Chriſt is without beginning of dayes, or end of life</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> This anſwer is too light and frothy in a ſubject ſo ſerious; It was not mine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent or deſigne, (and he knows it very well) to make <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> God, nor any of the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48559:45"/> perſons of the Godhead, nor yet to make a quaternity of perſons, but to make Chriſt God, to whom that in truth belongs, which in type only, and in a figure, myſtically is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to <hi>Melchiſedech. Moſes</hi> and <hi>David</hi> ſpeak of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> as if he had been one who had glided down out of heaven, and come from above, and had again ſoon after conveyed himſelf thither; for there is not any mention at all made of his birth, or death, of his father, or mother, or kindred, or when he became Prieſt, nor when he laid down his Prieſthood. And the Apoſtle ſaw the myſterie in it, and that it behoved him ſo to be deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and ſet out, that he might be a Type of Chriſt, both of his Perſon, and Prieſthood. And therefore when he makes uſe of him as a Type to ſet out Chriſt by, he deſcribes him to be without father, and ſo was Chriſt as he was man; and without mother, and ſo was Chriſt as he was God, having no beginning of dayes, nor end of life; nor had Chriſt (according to his divine Nature conſidered) either beginning, or end of dayes; but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ording to his humane, he had both, and both of them deſcribed, and well known by all that are verſed in Scripture-ſtory; and the Apoſtle knowing theſe things, in expreſſe words makes <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> the Type of him, diſcerning, that the Holy Ghoſt (in concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48559:46"/> theſe things of him) had made him ſo, and intended him to be ſo, as theſe words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, <hi>Made like unto the Son of God, for he is deſcribed</hi> (ſaith <hi>Beza) as if he had neither been mortall man, nor had been born of a mortall woman; which becauſe it could by no means a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with any meer man born of men; therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, that he is peculiarly the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of that one only begotten Son of God, and that it was ſo intended by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now then the ſtrength of the Argument fetch'd from this Scripture, lies here, Firſt, <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> is a Type of Chriſt; that is without controverſie. Secondly, He is a Type in theſe things mentioned of him, <hi>Without father, without mother, without beginning of dayes, and end of time.</hi> Otherwiſe in vain doth the Apoſtle mention theſe things of <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedech,</hi> but as a type; for in truth, it was not ſo of <hi>Melchiſedech.</hi> And it appears by the ſcope of the Apoſtle, which was to interpret the words of <hi>David, A Prieſt after the order of Melchiſedech;</hi> therefore it was neceſſary for him to ſet forth what <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was in his perſon, and in his office; and in his perſon he was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48559:46"/> Thirdly, <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> (being only a type in theſe things of Chriſt) it was not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that he ſhould be ſuch in truth, but only in a figure, myſtically, as indeed he was not; but it was neceſſary, that Chriſt ſhould be ſo in truth, being the Anti-type, that is, being the ſubſtance of that which <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was but a ſhadow of; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in <hi>John</hi> 1. 17. it is ſaid, that <hi>the law was given by Moſes, but grace and truth came by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> That is, there were many ſhadows in the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but Chriſt came and fulfilled them, and was the truth of them. We read of <hi>David,</hi> that he ſaid of himſelfe, <hi>They pierced my hands and my feet, they gave me vineger and gall to drink;</hi> which really were not done to <hi>David,</hi> but my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtically, and in a figure, as <hi>David</hi> was the type of Chriſt; but theſe things were really done to Chriſt, and in truth were fulfilled in Chriſt. So the bloud of buls and calves and of ſuch beaſts which were ſacrificed, and offered, they took away ſin, cleanſed away the guilt, and brought pardon, and purged the conſcience, and brought peace; but none of theſe did ſo in truth, but myſtically, in type only, as they ſhadowed out, and pointed at the ſacrifice of Chriſt, and at his bloud: but the bloud of Chriſt really and in truth did take away ſin, did clenſe the conſcience, did bring remiſſion &amp; peace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 9, 12, 13, 14.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48559:47"/> More inſtances might be given, but indeed there is evidence enough in the very nature of a type, and antitype. There is a myſtery in the type, and there is the impletion or fulfilling of the myſtery in the Antitype, or the thing of the myſtery, is to be ſeen in the Antitype. But enough of this, unleſs he had ſaid more to impugne it.</p>

But in this place, it is an obtaining or poſſeſſing as is done by generation; I gave an inſtance in <hi>Eve</hi> in reference to <hi>Cain.</hi> I have gotten a man: it
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48559:47"/> was by a begetting or generating there, and in this place it is ſo alſo; Chriſt is called the onely begotten of the Father: and here in <hi>ver.</hi> 24. Chriſt the wiſdome of God, declares, how he was poſſeſſed, <hi>viz.</hi> as a <hi>Son</hi> that is brought forth by a woman travelling; in which Chriſt is ſaid to be born, and is called the firſt-born, to exclude creation, and that it might be by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; and the act of the Father in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating the divine eſſence to the Son, is called (after the manner of men, that it may be better conceived of) a begetting, or generating, ſute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to which is the Hebrew word <hi>Amun, v.</hi> 30. w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ſignifies a child nurſed, nouriſhed, brought up with a father, and ſuch was Chriſt; which is thus expreſſed, to hold forth his generation, and not creation; for when God created <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> he created him a man; but Chriſt is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as a child, to ſhew how he was begotten: and it is added, that Chriſt was his Fathers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and a ſport before him, (for ſo it is in the Hebrew) and this is <hi>humanitùs dictum,</hi> is is ſpoken after the manner of Fathers, who take dear delight in the childe that comes out of their owne bowels; and when it is little, it is very pleaſant, and makes the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſport; and by it is ſignified to us, what an one Chriſt was, what a ſon he was, that he was his owne proper ſon, not created but ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated; having his very eſſence from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48559:48"/> by an act of eternall generation, and in whom God taketh delight, after the manner of parents in a child that comes out of their bowells, and is a part of themſelves, that is, the higheſt &amp; deareſt delight, and the moſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and intimate delight, beyond which there neither is or can be any delight. It is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt therefore that he confounds things that muſt not be confounded, he would have poſſeſſing or obtaining to be one with creating in this place, but it is a groſs miſtake in him.</p>
               <p>But when was it that God did thus poſſeſs or beget Chriſt? He would have it to be <hi>when God began to work; then God created Chriſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>before his works of old.</hi> But it is manifeſt, that the very words, that ſet forth Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity are uſed here. See two of the words, <hi>Megnolam</hi> which ſignifies from everlaſting, and <hi>Meas</hi> which ſignifies <hi>à tunc,</hi> from then, or from of old, as it is tranſlated; and both are uſed in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. 2. and applied to the moſt high God. <hi>Thy throne is eſtabliſhed of old, thou art from everlaſting;</hi> and <hi>kedem</hi> is in many places applyed to God, for ſuch antiquity which is eternity, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 27. <hi>the eternall God is my refuge;</hi> ſo that Chriſts eternity is ſet forth in this place of the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> He was brought forth or poſſeſſed from eternity. And though it be ſaid, <hi>in the beginning of his way,</hi> yet this makes nothing againſt Chriſts
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48559:48"/> eternity, becauſe it is added, that it was before his works; ſo that this <hi>[was]</hi> points at eternity: for who will aſſert that creation was the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Gods way? did God act nothing before he created? it is undoubtedly falſe.

                  <hi>Repl.</hi> That the word in the Originall ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, either Citizen, Lieutenent, Vicar, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative, is barely aſſerted; and if he have ſo ſtrictly ſurveyed the originall, as that he dare challenge me for not ſurveying it, he might have done well to have directed me, or the Reader, to the places where the word admits of ſuch acceptions; but this he hath not done, therefore I ſhall conclude, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he hath preſented his owne imagination inſteed of the true ſenſe of the word, or more probably hath relyed upon ſome who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him. I have viewed the originall, and do find, that the word <hi>Gnamith,</hi> which is rendred <hi>Socius, proximus,</hi> proceeds from the the radix <hi>Gnammath,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>ſecundùm, juxta,</hi> and ſometimes, <hi>è regione, ex adverſo,</hi> and is as much as <hi>Ca-aſher,</hi> which is rendred <hi>prout,</hi> all which do hold forth equality. To begin with this laſt, <hi>prout</hi> is rightly tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>even as,</hi> the ſon Chriſt is even as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I ſuppoſe it cannot be ſpoken of any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo, the words <hi>è regione, ex adverſo,</hi> are rendred <hi>over againſt, right against,</hi> which is ſpoken of a thing or perſon that matcheth an other, ſet this againſt that to fellow it, or
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48559:50"/> match it. But what creature is there that may be ſet up <hi>è regione Dei patris,</hi> oppoſite to God, to match him? And ſo, <hi>ſecundum, juxta,</hi> which ſignifie <hi>according, hard by, beſide</hi> or <hi>nigh</hi> another thing, or perſon; and it is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred equal, <hi>juxta à jugo,</hi> ſaith the Etymologiſt. Now fellows are joyned in the yoke, ſuch a nighneſſe, as that the ſon fellows the Father; And if the words do any of them, ſometimes in their uſe, import an afterneſſe, or a ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and following, it may be granted; and yet to the other ſenſe that they carry of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality, hold notwithſtanding: for in order of ſubſiſting and working (though in nature and eſſence not ſo) the Son is after, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and yet is God the Fathers fellow.</p>
               <p>I grant that the word is rendred a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, in <hi>Levit.</hi> 6. 2. and <hi>proximus</hi> is Engli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed a neighbour, and therefore I accord with <hi>Tremelius,</hi> who ſaith, the Hebrew word doth ſound as much as <hi>proximus,</hi> a neighbour; and we know who is mans neighbour, one of the ſame kind, a man like himſelfe, and in that reſpect his fellow, his equall. But who is this Lord of Hoaſts neighbour? any meere man conſiſting onely of ſoul and body? Then God and man have one and the ſame neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: but it is little leſs then blaſphemy to ſay, that any creature is Gods neighbour; no, it is a perſon of the ſame nature and eſſence
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48559:51"/> that is his neighbour, the eternall Son of God is the Fathers neighbour, was nigh him and by him from Eternity. And to be in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of the Father, and at his right hand, is not a place fit for any meere creature, but fit for one equall.</p>
               <p>But he makes two collections from the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the word,</p>
               <p>1. Saith he, <hi>Christ is the principall object of Gods deareſt love: The man my fellow whom I moſt love, ſaith</hi> Grotius.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> This will be readily granted, and the other <hi>viz.</hi> coequallity not impedited nor gainſaid by it, for the Father loves his coequall better then all others; and becauſe he is of the ſame nature, and therein coequall, therfore he loves him beſt.</p>
               <p>2. Saith he, <hi>Chriſt is Gods principall ſervant in his high tranſactions, one that is Gods repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> That Chriſt according to his humane nature is Gods ſervant, is granted; but that it may be collected from this place of <hi>Zachery</hi> that he is Gods ſervant, or that the Hebrew word tranſlated <hi>fellow,</hi> doth import ſo much, or that whole Chriſt is Gods ſervant, is denyed, and is not proved by him; but is his naked aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion.</p>
               <p>He concludes thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I might now collect from the words ſomething</hi>

                  <hi>to oppoſe the doctrine you aſſert, they being ſpoken of a man, and in reference to the Lord of Hoſts, who cannot poſſibly have an equall, unleſs it were poſſible to have two Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> This man that is ſpoken of in the words which have been now diſcuſſed, is that Lord of Hoaſts ſpoken of in <hi>Zech.</hi> 2. 8, 9, 10, 11.

               <p>The next Scripture in my paper, that I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him with for the confirming of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted truth of Chriſt's Godhead, was <hi>John</hi> 3. 13. <hi>No man hath aſcended up into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but he that came down from heaven, the Son of man, which is in heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this Text he gives this anſwer, by which he would evade the omnipreſence of Chriſt, and ſo not confeſſe him to be God.</p>

               <p> 
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> This interpretation is neither concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant to it ſelfe, nor to the truth. 1. To it ſelfe it agrees not, becauſe <hi>aſcending,</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending,</hi> and <hi>exiſting</hi> in relating all to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, are all to be taken either literally, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the words ſound, or elſe they are all to be taken metaphorically, and ſpiritually; but he expounds ſome of them in a myſticall figurative ſenſe, and others in a plain literall ſenſe. To aſcend up to heaven, is not to be underſtood (as he gives the expoſition) of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall aſcenſion, but of a mentall contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And to be in heaven, is only in a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſenſe, in ſpeculation, in beholding with the eyes of the ſoul, divine things, and the Fathers ſecrets. But to deſcend from heaven, that muſt have no metaphoricall ſenſe, as the reſt had, but a literall ſenſe put upon it, and the deſcenſion muſt be perſonall. Now here is a diſcordancie in theſe things, and he gives no reaſon of this varying, in his interpreting. Aſcending and deſcending are alſo oppoſites, and if ſo, then they muſt be taken in an oppoſite ſenſe; if <hi>aſcending</hi> then be taken for deep knowledge, and ſcience of divine things; then <hi>deſcending</hi> is departing from deep knowledge, and ſcience of divine things; which will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry abſurd in his own conceptions. 2. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition agrees not with the truth; for <hi>aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> in Scripture, is taken when it refers to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48559:52"/> Chriſt, as well as when it refers to others. In another ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> in the plain literall externall ſenſe, <hi>John</hi> 6. 62. <hi>What if you ſhall ſee the Son of man aſcend up where he was before.</hi> And <hi>chap.</hi> 20. 17. <hi>I aſcend unto my Father and unto your Father, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>touch me not, I am not yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended.</hi> And <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 8, 9, 10. And I do not remember any one place, where aſcending into heaven, is taken in his ſenſe, but in the literall ſenſe. And it ſeems to be diſcrepant and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing to the phraſe and manner of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture expreſſion. For when divine knowledge and wiſdome is ſpoken of, or other ſuch gifts, they are ſaid to come down from heaven, from above unto men; and men are not ſaid to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend up to heaven, though there may be a truth in it, that a man aſcends up to heaven, not in his knowing ſo much, as in the uſe of his knowledge, in his beholding and viewing of ſpirituall things.</p>
               <p>And if a ſpirituall ſenſe is not proper unto aſcending into heaven, then is not Chriſt's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in heaven to be interpreted in a ſpirituall or myſticall ſenſe; but look in what ſenſe he aſcended and deſcended, in that ſenſe it may be ſaid he is in heaven, that is, in a literall ſenſe; nor is this ſpiritual ſenſe of theſe words <hi>(is in heaven)</hi> agreeable to the acception of the like words, and phraſe of ſpeaking uſed elſe-where in <hi>John</hi> 17. 24. <hi>Father, I will that</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:48559:53"/> 
                  <hi>thoſe whom thou haſt given me, be where I am, that they may behold my glory.</hi> Chriſt here ſpeaks of heaven, and of his glory in heaven, and of the diſciples coming thither, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding his glory there; and he ſpeaks not in a myſticall ſenſe, of his own knowledge of divine things, nor of the diſciples knowing of ſuch things, as he knew; but in a literall ſenſe he ſpeaks all, and he ſaith, <hi>I am there,</hi> and yet he was on earth, according to his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: but he was in heaven alſo, <hi>Where I am,</hi> ſaith he, that was heaven, Chriſt was there. How was that poſſible, if Chriſt was not God? &amp; if the words be taken literally there, in <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 24 then they are literally to be taken here, in <hi>John</hi> 3. 13. The place diſcuſſed betwixt us, the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of theſe two places together, clears the ſenſe of both, and is repugnant to his interpretation.</p>
               <p>And though he gives a literall ſenſe to theſe words, <hi>(But he that came down from heaven) viz.</hi> the Son being excepted, who was in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and deſcended thence; yet it is a corrupt, and falſe, and very dangerous ſenſe that he gives, which I met with in my former Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe. For he repreſents Chriſt in his deſcenſion as leaving heaven, departing from thence, and coming upon earth; but this is contrary to the next expreſſions, the ſenſe of which I have cleared up, where it is ſaid, that Chriſt was in heaven ſtill, notwithſtanding that he
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48559:53"/> deſcended, ſo that it is a reall true deſcention, or a true coming and appearing upon earth, but not locall, ſuch as is appliable to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for that is not proper to Chriſt. The creature in deſcending moves from the place it was in, and leaves it: but 'tis not ſo to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of Chriſt. But thus, Chriſt is ſaid to deſcend in reference to his incarnation, he being the Son of God aſſumed fleſh of the Virgine, by the divine inſpiration of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, and ſo was made the Son of man, and ſo the Son of God, appeared in the Son of man, and this is called deſcending. This is made manifeſt to us from <hi>John</hi> 1. 14. <hi>The word was made fleſh, and dwelt among us,</hi> even the word dwelt among us in fleſh, and we beheld his glory in fleſh, the glory as of the begotten Son of God. This glory was in heaven, now in the Sons aſſuming fleſh, it is ſeen on earth, in the ſeed of the woman: this is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending of Chriſt, and after this manner the moſt high God is ſaid to deſcend in Scripture, God came into the temple after this manner, not by moving from place to place, which is not congruous to God, but by a work, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring God to be there, where he was not ſeen before; And ſo God deſcended to ſee the tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that was built in a work, and no other way, and it is called deſcending after the manner of men, and it is Gods deſcending, all that
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:48559:54"/> is competent to God. And this kind of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending of Chriſt, muſt of neceſſity be yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto, becauſe the locall is excluded by Chriſt in the very place, where his deſcending is mentioned.</p>
               <p>Having ſhewed the inconſiſtency of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition which he framed, and gave of this Text of <hi>John,</hi> and having fortified the ſenſe in which I made uſe of it, and for which I produced it, I ſhall now anſwer unto that which by way of objection may be urged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſenſe that I have put upon it.</p>
               <p>Object.</p>
               <p>It may be thus argued; A locall corporeall aſcenſion cannot be underſtood in reference to Chriſt, becauſe it is expreſſed in the preterperfect-Tenſe, as a thing done; but that was (in a literall locall acception taken) inconſiſtent to Chriſt, becauſe he was then upon earth, and as he ſaith afterward, was not aſcended to the Father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> The preterperfect-tenſe <hi>(hath aſcended)</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to <hi>no man,</hi> &amp; not to <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and there is an <hi>Elipſis</hi> in the words, or a defectiveneſs in the expreſſions in reference to Chriſt, &amp; therein of neceſſity that the words ſupplied ſhould run in the preterperfect-tenſe: but they may run in the future tenſe, thus, But <hi>he that deſcended, ſhall aſcend. viz.</hi> the Son of man which is in heaven.</p>
               <p>Or if the words ſhould be ſupplied in the preterperfect-tenſe, yet a change of tenſe
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48559:54"/> (which notes out the aſſurance of the thing: it is ſpoken of as done, becauſe aſſuredly it is to be done) cannot overturn the genuine ſenſe of the place.</p>
               <p>Obj.</p>
               <p>2. It may be farther objected, that the ſon of man is the ſubject who is ſaid to be in heaven, but the ſon of man is Chriſt under the conſideration of his manhood, and under that conſideration it was impoſſible for him to be at that time in heaven, for it is contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory to the truth of his humanity to be at two places ſo greatly diſtant at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Here is in theſe expreſſions, viz. <hi>the ſon of man which is in heaven,</hi> that which they call <hi>Idiomatum communicationem:</hi> that which is ſpoken in the concrete of Chriſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to one nature, transferred to another nature, is as he himſelf muſt confeſs in other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, according to his Tenent, to be often found in the Sripture; in theſe words, <hi>they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have crucified the Lord of glory,</hi> it is to be obſerved, Chriſt was crucified according to the fleſh, but he was not the Lord of glory accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fleſh, but ſpirit of holineſs, yet it is ſaid, the Lord of glory was crucified: ſo it is ſaid, the ſon of man was in heaven, but it is meant of the ſon of God; and the meaning is, the perſon that is called the ſon of man, was in heaven, though not as the ſon of man, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48559:55"/> to the other nature <hi>as the Son of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let us try the ſtrength of his reaſons, which he brings for the countenancing of this expoſition of his.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Saith he, <hi>this ſenſe and meaning where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall I have clothed thoſe words, is no waies oppoſite to the analogie of faith; There is nothing (as I ſuppoſe) in it, which the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel will pick a quarrell with.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> The nakedneſs of this reaſon is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in what I have already preſented, I have ſhewed that Chriſts aſcending up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is not any where taken in that ſenſe which he puts upon it. And that Chriſts being in heaven in the ſenſe that he clothes it with, is repugnant to a paralell place in <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 24. ſo that he makes Scripture quarrell with it ſelfe, and ſuch an expoſition which he hath given of Chriſts deſcending, ſtands at defiance againſt all thoſe pregnant places which do proclaim Chriſt to be coeſſential with the Father: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both Old Teſtament and New will riſe up againſt it, and condemn it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He ſaith, <hi>That the ſenſe that he would have this Text to own, is elſewhere challenged by the like phraſes to themſelves, as their due.</hi> And he mentions <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 4. <hi>Who hath aſcended up into heaven, and deſcended?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:48559:55"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> Some conceive that <hi>Agur</hi> ſpeaks of God in the perſons of the Father and the Son, whom he deſcribes to aſcend up into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and deſcend, to give ſignes of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in both places, and be every where; and who gathers the winds in his fiſt, and binds the waters in a garment; and that he propoſeth this as an hard queſtion to his two friends <hi>Ithiel</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>cal.</hi> Others conceive that <hi>Agur</hi> doth ſpeak of man, and that his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation is in the force and vertue of it a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Who hath aſcended?</hi> &amp;c. that is, no man can do ſuch things as he mentions; and that if his friends do know any that can effect ſuch things, let them <hi>declare what his name is, and what his ſons name is.</hi> But they all underſtand it of aſcending to the very place of heaven; and not any (that I have ſeen) in the ſenſe that he drives at: nor doth either the text or context neceſſitate, that this aſcending ſhould be a diſcovering of Gods hidden ſecrets, for what then is deſcending? As for <hi>Piſcator,</hi> I have never ſeen him upon the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> and can ſay nothing to it.</p>
               <p>He mentions <hi>Pauls</hi> rapture into the third heaven to be only a diſcovery of the things of God. It's ſomewhat preſumptuous for him to determine, when the Apoſtle himſelf durſt not: for, <hi>whether he was in the body, or out of the body, he could not tell.</hi> But if his rapture
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:48559:56"/> were not reall, it was in viſion; and to the third heaven and paradiſe he went either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally or in viſion; to the place he went, that he might underſtand the thing.</p>
               <p>But he quotes <hi>Grotius,</hi> and <hi>Muſculus,</hi> and <hi>Bucer,</hi> as Writers who underſtand <hi>aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in a ſpirituall ſenſe for penetrating the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of heaven.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe ſome good Expoſitors do ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the word <hi>aſcend;</hi> but how it will <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drare,</hi> and what adequateneſs there will be betwixt the ſenſe they give to the word <hi>aſcend,</hi> and the ſenſe they put upon the word <hi>deſcend,</hi> I cannot underſtand. However it be, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of Expoſitors in the interpretation of <hi>aſcending,</hi> will avail him nothing in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the controverſie betwixt him and me; for it lies not in that word, but in theſe words, <hi>is in heaven,</hi> whether they be literally to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, or in reſpect of knowledge onely: &amp; Expoſitors do not at all countenance his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphoricall ſenſe he gives of thoſe words, but they fall upon the diſtinction of Natures, and ſay, Chriſt was in heaven according to the Deity, but not in heaven according to the Humanity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He ſaith, <hi>his ſenſe is fitly conjoyned with the context. Chriſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>reproves Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus his unbeleef, aggravating it from the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the things ſpoken, We ſpeak what we</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> All may be granted that he ſaith, till he come to the 13. <hi>ver.</hi> which is more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly an explication of the 11. <hi>ver. We ſpeak what we know, and teſtifie what we have ſeen,</hi> ſaith Chriſt. <hi>Nichodemus</hi> and others might object againſt the certainty of thoſe things that Chriſt aſſerted, and might ſay, The judgments and wayes of the Lord are unſearchable, who hath known the mind of the Lord? Who ſhall aſcend into heaven for us, to relate the mind of the Lord to us? Unto this Chriſt anſwers, No man hath aſcended, nor can aſcend up to heaven to make diſcovery of the will of God, of the deep things of God, but the onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son; he came from God, and he aſcends thither again, and he hath ſeen and known, and what he hath ſeen he declares, and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies; and if you be not ſatisfied with that which the Son hath brought you from heaven, who alſo aſcends thither again, it is an aggravation of your unbelief. And unto this coherence,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:48559:57"/> there is a concurrence of Expoſitors in their witneſſe.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <p>The laſt Scripture is now to be diſcuſſed (which he hath excepted againſt, and labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to diſable, that it might not ſpeak that which I brought it to give witneſſe to; which was to juſtifie the deity of Chriſt) and it is <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 5. <hi>And now, ô Father, glorifie me with thine owne ſelfe, with the glory I had with thee before the World was.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He gives his gloſs to theſe words, after this manner.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> He knowes what is written in <hi>Rev.</hi>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:48559:57"/> 22. 18, 19. in terrour to thoſe that add to the word of God; I wonder therefore how he dare interpoſe words in this prayer of Chriſt according to his owne fancy, and not fear and tremble.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He inſerts theſe words into the preface of Chriſts prayer, <hi>Thou, O Father, who art the fountain of goodneſs.</hi> And this he doth unneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily, for in this prayer-of Chriſt there is no preface at all, and why ſhould be frame one? this is not to interpret Scripture, but it is plainly to add to it, and it is done with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, which makes it the worſe; for he would bring Chriſt in, acknowledging the Father the ſole fountain of goodneſſe, excluding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as Son of the Father, and excluding the Holy Ghoſt, which is a falſe thing, and full of injury to Chriſt; who was ſo far from making ſuch an acknowledgment, that he thought it not robbery to be equall with God, his aſſuming of equality with the Father, was not counted robbery by himſelfe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He inſerts theſe words in the cloſe of Chriſts prayer, ſpeaking of the glory Chriſt had with God, he addes theſe words, <hi>anſwerable to that high ſtate wherein thy pleaſure was to ſet me, and to that great dominion wherewithall thou wast pleaſed to invest me.</hi> Theſe words, <hi>wherein thy good pleaſure was to ſet me, and wherewithall thou wast pleaſed to invest me,</hi> are
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48559:58"/> not in the text, nor is there any thing that lookes that way, that might give him occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to extract them, and preſent them, as if there they might be found, or ſomething like them, which will bear them; nor doth he bring any other text to make it appear, that ſuch words are agreeable to the Analogie of faith. But by this addition he makes Chriſt a meere creature, a creature before he tooke fleſh, before the World was, while he was with God. And he makes the glory which he had to be a derived glory, and given to Chriſt of meere grace, and good pleaſure. Now this is moſt notoriouſly falſe, as I have largely and amply proved in my former Treatiſe. But this is the doctrine that fils his head, and fils his heart, and there is ſo much of this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, that he thinks every Scripture that he lookes upon contains it, and therefore it is that he brings this Scripture, ſpeaking that which it ſpeakes not.</p>
               <p>But ſetting aſide theſe additions, for which he muſt give an account. Be it that Chriſts prayer had this meaning, I ſhall ſhew you what an inconſiſtency there is in theſe words to his opinion, in two or three parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Suppoſing Chriſt (before he tooke the Seed of <hi>Ahraham</hi> upon him) to be a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſoul, made by and abiding with God, be
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:48559:58"/> fore the reſt of the creatures were made (for this is his opinion) how can Chriſt ſpeake to God theſe words? <hi>Who have emptied my ſelfe, taking to me a naturall, and mortall body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If Chriſt were but a created ſoul, could it be an act of his will, and of his power, to take to him a body? did ever God leave any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at liberty to do what he will? to chuſe or refuſe at his pleaſure? that he ſhould leave Chriſt (this created ſoul as he makes him) at liberty, to take a body, or not to take it? and if not, but that God commanded him to take it, why doth he plead it with God for reward, as if it had been done of courteſie? Have any of the Angels, when they have waited upon men (a worke below them) had liberty to plead with God after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? And how could it be an act of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to take to him a body, he being but a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated ſoul? can a created ſoul build a body of nothing (if by creation it be?) or build it out of a woman without the help of man (if by generation it be (as indeed it was?) and if not, how comes Chriſt to plead it as ſome meritorious act, I have emptied my ſelfe in taking to me a naturall mortall body? If God prepared him a body, why doth he ſay, I emptied my ſelfe and tooke it? So that here is abſurdity enough in this, if there were no
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:48559:59"/> more in reference to his opinion, in theſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry words.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If Chriſt were a created ſoul, where was the Emptying to take a naturall and mortall body? is there not an habitude and naturall propenſeneſſe in the ſoul to be in the body? is it not the ſoules perfection? is not the ſoul imperfect without it? is it any more then a part of the whole, and with the body makes a perfect man? and is this the condeſcention (to be preſented as an high piece of ſelfe deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all) to be in a perfect ſtate? And doth the ſoul take the body, any more then the body take the ſoul? or doth not God take both and unite them? here is neither Divinity nor Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy in this.</p>
               <p>But it may be, this emptying was in this, that Chriſt a glorious ſoul, tooke a naturall mortall body, not a body glorified, but vile by reaſon of a naturall corruptibility; But 1. God prepared this body for him; where was then this excellent piece of ſelfe denyall, to take and accept of what God prepares, though it were an abaſing to him? Saints tread in ſuch ſteps of ſelfe denyall every day, and it is but their duty. 2. Men are and ought to be thankful to God for ſuch naturall and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall bodies, and for every member thereof, and Chriſt, if but a created ſoul, might well ſubmit, yea be thankfull that his ſoul was not
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48559:59"/> as his body; for it was of free-grace (as he ſaith, and I joyn with him in it, if he were a created ſoul) that he was ſo glorious a ſoul. 3. <hi>Lazarus</hi> was called (ſo far as concerned a naturall mortall body, and further alſo) to the like piece of ſelf-denyall: for his ſoul was in heaven, and with God, and made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect with God, and glorified with him; and it muſt leave God, and leave heaven, and leave glory, and come into a naturall mortall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy again, that muſt dye a ſecond time; yea, into a ſinfull tabernacle again; and this muſt be done at the Command of Chriſt, according to the will of God. What ſelf-denyall was this then, if Chriſt's was ſo great, when yet Chriſt was but only a glorified ſoul; And <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> which was ſuch, yet might not <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> plead it? This is another abſurdity which follows from his own words, upon his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: Chriſt being but a created ſoul at the firſt with God.</p>
               <p>2. He makes Chriſt to ask of God the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry only which he had in heaven before the world was; and indeed Chriſt asked no other but it. Now this is not conſiſtent with Chriſts being a created ſoul, and a creature; for it is manifeſt from the Scripture, yea, it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by himſelfe in many places of his printed paper, That Chriſt as a creature had greater glory by donation, after his ſufferings, after
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48559:60"/> his deep humiliation, then ever he had as a creature before; for that Heirſhip of all things, and dominion, and principality, and height above all principality, and that name above every name, was the reward which God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon him in reference to the croſſe which he bore; and it was his higheſt glory as a creature; therefore it is expreſſed in theſe words, <hi>is made both Lord and Chriſt;</hi> not reſtored to what he had, but made: and what a rewarding is that, only to reſtore him to what he had at firſt? Therefore ſeeing that Chriſt prayes here in <hi>John</hi> for the glory that he had with God before the world was, and asked no more; and ſeeing it is as evident, that as a creature his greateſt glory was not before his ſufferings, but after, and was the reward of his ſufferings; it will neceſſarily follow, that he prayes for divine glory to be reſtored, and that as a creature he was not with God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world was, nor had glory as a creature.</p>
               <p>3. He ſaith, and the Text ſaith, that the glory that Chriſt asked of his Father, was the glory before the world was, but the glory which Chriſt had as a creature, could not be the glory before the world was; for he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe confeſſeth, that that glory which he had as a creature, conſiſted in heirſhip and dominion over the world; but this heirſhip and dominion over the world, was not, nor could
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48559:60"/> be before the world was: it will therefore follow, that either Chriſt was created with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out glory, and had no glory till the world was created, which is directly contradictory to the Text; or if he had a glory, it was not any created glory, for that conſiſted in domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which was not til the world was; and then what glory could it be, but that which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for, divine uncreated glory, which holds forth him to be an uncreated and eternal being; and by conſequence to be the moſt high God?</p>
               <p>But he brings reaſons for his own tenent, that whole Chriſt is a creature, from this Text of <hi>John,</hi> and attempts the overthrow of my aſſertion of Chriſts Deity, which I contend for from this Text.</p>
               <p>1. Saith he, <hi>If Chriſt were equall with the Father, why doth Chriſt direct his prayer to his Father? There had been no need, nor can cauſe be ſhewed, why he ſhould ſupplicate to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and not act relyance on the Godhead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> I have rendred reaſons for it in my former Treatiſe, in my reply to his fift argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was this, <hi>He that acteth with dependance on another, is a creature, but whole Chriſt acteth with dependance.</hi> To which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the reader, becauſe it is largely diſcuſſed there; and it is a tedious unpleaſing thing to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48559:61"/> multiply repetitions, though he delights him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe too much therein: yet leſt that Treatiſe ſhould not be at hand, I ſhall ſatisfie the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thus far. It behooved the Godhead in the perſon of the Son to be veyled, for this was the Sons emptying of himſelfe; but not ſo the Godhead in the perſon of the Father; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Son acts not dependance upon the Godhead that dwelt in himſelf in the perſon of the Son; or as it was in himſelf, but as it was in the Father.</p>
               <p>2. He ſaith, <hi>We do not uſe to pray, but praiſe for things we have, if we know that we have them. Now Chriſt could not want the higheſt glory in any ſenſe, if he were a perſon in the Trinity, coequall with the Father, eſpecially not be without it, with the Father, nor in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in any ſenſe whatſoever, as by the clouding, darkning, or obſcuring of it; therefore the glory which he had with the Father, was not the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt glory, but a glory proceeding from the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; and by conſequence, Chriſt was but a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> It is true, that the higheſt glory (he being a perſon in the Trinity coequall with the Father) could not be ſeparated from him, for it follows the divine eſſence, and cannot be divided from it; but it might be, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deedwas obſcured, and clouded, not to the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48559:61"/> Father, nor to the Son himſelfe; for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaw it, and gave witneſſe to it, and ſo did the Son, and comprehended it fully: but to the creature it was darkned and obſcured, and but ſome ſmall beams and rayes of it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared; the Son was incarnate, or in fleſh, but the glory of the Son appeared not in fleſh in fulneſſe of luſtre, like the glory of the Son; but the form of God in the Son was veyled and hidden in the form of a ſervant; Now Chriſt prayes that that eſſentiall divine glory might be manifeſted in fleſh, that he the Son in fleſh might appear in glory, when he ſhould come to heaven, as he did before he took fleſh; that as the Godhead was hidden in the manhood, ſo the manhood might be glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Godhead, that the fleſh might be taken up into the fellowſhip of the glory of the Divinity, by the ſhining forth and breaking out of the glory of the Divinity in the fleſh.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>It appears</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that the glory which he had with the Father was not divine, or the higheſt glory, becauſe it was to be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Glorifie me, O Father, with that glory, &amp;c. Now the higheſt glory being infinite, could not be given or communicated to the humane nature, which was finite, and ſo uncapable of it, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> Though the divine glory cannot be
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48559:62"/> communicated to humane nature, ſo as that it ſhould be inherent in the humane nature; yet it may gloriouſly ſhine forth upon it, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in it, which it did not before: yea by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the hypoſtaticall union betwixt the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature and the humane nature, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the divine nature becomes the glory of the whole perſon, ſo as that when the glory of the Son ſhines forth in its greateſt ſtrength in the fleſh, it may be predicated and aſſerted of the man Chriſt, that he is glorified with the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which the Son had with the Father before the world was; Becauſe the man Chriſt is the ſame perſon with the eternall Son of God.</p>
               <p>Thus all the Scriptures which I drew wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to, that Jeſus Chriſt is the true God, and the moſt high God, notwithſtanding all his endeavours to ſuffocate their teſtimony, and his attempts by violence to ſilence them, that they ſhould not ſpeak what they would ſpeak, yet they have with open mouth, with one conſent, given glory unto Chriſt, by witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to his Godhead, and to his coeſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alneſs, and to his coequality with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude my Vindication of them with theſe words, <hi>Let God be true</hi> in what he hath teſtifyed of his Son in Scripture,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:48559:62"/> 
                  <hi>and every man</hi> that oppoſeth let him be <hi>a lyer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My next undertaking muſt be the defence of the Arguments which I produced, and drew up from Scripture, by which I attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to prove the deſtructiveneſſe of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which he holds (making whole Chriſt a creature) to the true Goſpel, and oppoſite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it to the Scripture in many main points and truths of it.</p>
               <p>My Aſſertion was, That the doctrine which makes Chriſt a meer creature, brings in (as it were) another Goſpel, and deſtroyes the true Goſpel in many parts thereof; and brings in another Scripture in many main points.</p>
               <p>He cals this a reaſon againſt his doctrine of Chriſt a meere creature; and ſo it is, not onely to ſhew the falſeneſſe of ſuch doctrine, but alſo to diſcover the horridneſſe and hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the doctrine, that all might be warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of it, and with fear and trembling may decline it.</p>
               <p>But he wiſheth him to be <hi>Anathema</hi> that holds any ſuch doctrine, that deſtroyes the Goſpel or the Scripture, and falls upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of the inſtances or Arguments which I produced to confirme that generall reaſon.</p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:48559:63"/>
               <p> Therefore becauſe he is ſo confident, that his doctrine will not prove ſuch; and becauſe he hath poſſeſſed the people, that though there ſhould be a miſtake in it on his part, yet it is not ſo dangerous as I would make it; and that the ſalvation of mens ſoules is not ſo nearly concerned in it, as I would have men to conceive; and that Chriſt is never a whit leſs a ſufficient Saviour, though but a creature; and that it is enough to beleeve unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that Chriſt is Lord, <hi>viz. made Lord;</hi> and that God raiſed him from the dead; by which means perſons have become leſſe ſolicitous what doctrine they entertain, they ſee it hath a ſpecious ſhew, and conceive it will not prove deſtructive, though it ſhould prove falſe; therefore I think it expedient to fortifie my poſition, which reſpects the oppoſiteneſſe of this doctrine of his, both to the Goſpel, and the teſtimony of other Scriptures, with ſome further proofes, not purpoſing at all to deſert my former grounds, (which I confide in as much as ever) but intending in my following diſcourſe to free them from his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions, by which he would elude the ſtrength of them.</p>
               <p>And thus I argue:</p>
            </div>
            <div n="1" type="argument">
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. That doctrine that denyes and deſtroyes that one onely true God, and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48559:63"/> brings in a ſtrange and a falſe God, that Doctrine deſtroyes the true Goſpel and Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and brings in another Goſpel and Scriptures: But this Doctrine of his, that makes whole Chriſt a creature, doth ſo: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Major admits of no doubt, becauſe the Scripture is cleer, that there is <hi>but one onely true God,</hi> Deut. 6. 4. 1 Cor. 8. 6.</p>
               <p>The Minor muſt have proof, and thus I confirm it: If the one onely true God be both three and one, three in Perſons, and one in Eſſence; be Father, Son, and Spirit, which are called three, and yet are but one; then that Doctrine which makes God to be but one and one, <hi>viz.</hi> one in perſon, and one in eſſence, and makes the Father onely to be God, excluding the Son and Spirit, denyes and deſtroyes the true God, and ſets up a falſe God.</p>
               <p>My proof for the Minor again (for the Major is unqueſtionable) is 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 7, 9. <hi>There are three that bear witneſs in heaven, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Word, and the Spirit, and theſe three are one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What will he anſwer to this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</p>
               <p>He will not deny, but that the three that are here ſpoken of, <hi>the Father, the Word, and the</hi>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:48559:64"/> 
                  <hi>Spirit</hi> are three perſons, (for he hath gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it all along in his diſcourſe, that they are three diſtinct perſons) but the oneneſs of theſe three in eſſence, is that which he denyes; that they are one God, is not yeilded by him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> are not found in one copy of the Greek; But this anſwer may be given, that in all other copies theſe words are found, which renders that copy, where they are wanting, ſuſpicious, and the 9. <hi>verſe</hi> makes it manifeſt that it is ſo; for the three witneſſes in the 7. <hi>ver.</hi> are called the witneſs of one God in <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>if we receive the witneſs of man, the witneſs of God is greater;</hi> what wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God is this? it is the witneſs of the three that was ſpoken of in <hi>ver.</hi> 7. which are ſaid to be but one God. And it is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, that the three witneſſes on earth, are ſaid to <hi>agree in one, ver.</hi> 8. but thoſe in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>be one:</hi> it is <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>However it be, there is ſtrength enough in this argument to them that grant the God-head of Chriſt; they muſt confeſs whether they will or no, that the true God is denyed, and a falſe God brought in: for if the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:48559:64"/> be God, and the Son be God, and the Son be not the Father, nor the Father the Son: and yet there be not two Gods, but one God; then this one God is the Father and Son, (I do not exclude the Spirit, but I ſpeak to thoſe who acknowledge Father and Son both of them to be God) they muſt confeſs that they are both of them but one and the ſame God; and then it comes to this, that the true God is one in two, and it is two in one, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their tenent, that is, one God in eſſence, and two in perſons, or two perſons in one eſſence: the conſequence of which is this, they muſt conclude, that whoever makes the eſſence to be one, and the perſon to be but one, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be God, and he alone to be God, and the Son not to be God, much leſs the holy Ghoſt, ſuch an one brings in a ſtrange God, and unſcripturall God, deſtroyes the true God which is Father and Son, as themſelves acknowledg, yea and Spirit alſo, as they will not deny. And how then can any ſuch perſon make the denying of Chriſt to be God a triviall errour, not greatly conſequential, nor of ſuch moment, as to be ſo greatly contended for? not fundamentall nor damnable, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:48559:65"/> in? when as yet it is the denying of the onely God, which is not Father alone, but Father, Son and Spirit.</p>
               <p>But why ſhould I conteſt with friends, which confeſſe the Diety of Chriſt? I am ſorry there ſhould be any occaſion, I will turn again upon the adverſary.</p>
               <p>Either Father and Son (I exclude not the Spirit, but I am pleading the Sons God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and not the Spirits, and ſhewing the heinouſneſs of the errour of denying it) I ſay either the Father and the Son are the onely God, or elſe there is no God at all, for the Scripture ſaith <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 30 <hi>that the Father and Chriſt are one in power,</hi> which is an eſſentiall attribute, and then they are one in eſſence, and ſo one God; and yet they are two diſtinct perſons. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 17. 18. <hi>It is written in your law, that the teſtimony of two men is true, I am one that bear witneſs of my ſelf, and my Father heareth witneſs of me.</hi> If the Father and the Son be two diſtinct witneſſes, then they two are diſtinct perſons; for none can be witneſſes but perſons; and two manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſame perſon cannot be ſaid to be two diſtinct witneſſes; nor would the proof which is fetcht from the law (where the witneſſes were diſtinct perſons) be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:48559:65"/> But he will confeſs this, that the Father and Son are diſtinct perſons, and diſtinct witneſſes alſo: and if ſo, he cannot with any face deny the other, that they are one, as well as two, becauſe Chriſt ſaith ſo in the above named place; one, <hi>viz.</hi> in power, in eſſence, in Godhead. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the very context (where they are called two witneſſes) will witneſs that they are but one God. the Jews reject his witneſs of himſelf, ſuch as they took him to be, which was a meer man (for the law alowed it not that any man ſhould be admitted to bear witneſs of himſelf;) but he notwithſtanding bears himſelf out by the law, to be an adequate witneſſe of himſelf; but herein he hath recourſe to that of himſelf, which they ſaw not, which they knew not, as <hi>ver.</hi> 14. ſhewes, <hi>I know whence I came, ye cannot tell whence I came.</hi> He could not mean it of his ſoul, for they could not look upon him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſoul, and ſoul and body made but one man; and notwithſtanding both, he would be an unadequate witneſs of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: But he means another thing, diſtinct both from ſoul and body, and from his manhood; which might be a witneſs of him as man, and this could be nothing
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:48559:66"/> but his Godhead and he joynes himſelf (according to this) with the Father, as a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct witneſs, but the ſame God. The reſult is then, that the one true <hi>God,</hi> though but one in eſſence, yet is not one ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but ſubſiſts in a plurality of perſons. Therefore he that makes his ſubſiſtence to be ſingle, and ſuch as his eſſence is, denyes and deſtroyes this one onely God. Which I prove further.</p>
               <p>The Father is ſaid to be <hi>the onely true God, John</hi> 17. 3. and the Son is called the <hi>true God,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 20. This Adjective <hi>[onely]</hi> refers not to the ſubject perſon <hi>Father,</hi> but refers to the predicate or thing that the Father is ſaid to be, <hi>viz. the true God,</hi> which is but <hi>onely</hi> one, which is clear from a paralell place in <hi>Jer.</hi> 22. 30. where the word <hi>onely</hi> is uſed in like manner, the children of Iſrael and <hi>Judah</hi> have <hi>onely done evill, have onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked me,</hi> The word <hi>onely</hi> is not to be applyed to the ſubject perſons ſpoken of, as if they onely, and no other people had done evill, and provoked God; but it is to be applyed to the thing that is ſpoken of them, <hi>they have only done evill, and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provoked;</hi> that is, they have done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but evill, nothing elſe but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke;
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:48559:66"/> ſo in <hi>John,</hi> the Father is ſaid to be the one only true God, but not he only to be the true God; for the Son is called the true <hi>God</hi> as wel as he, in the place before named in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 20. Whence I argue, that the one only true God is Father and Son, (as for the holy Ghoſt, I always include him though I have not occaſion to ſpeak of him here:) &amp; there is no God, no true God, but that God that is Father and Son; and he that denys either of theſe, denyes this one onely true <hi>God.</hi> He then that acknowlegeth the perſon of the Father to be <hi>God,</hi> but acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the perſon of the Son to be God, brings in a ſtrange God, an unſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall God, and a falſe God. For there is no ſuch God as ſubſiſts in the perſon of the Father onely; and hence it is that the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 22, 23. he is an Antichriſt that denyeth the Father and the Son: And he that denyeth the Son, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Father alſo; that is, ſuch an one acknowledgeth not the true God at all, what-ever men may think of him.</p>
               <p>Yet further, the Father is called the <hi>only God, Joh.</hi> 17. 3. &amp; <hi>Chriſt</hi> is cald the <hi>only God, Jud.</hi> 4, 24, 25. But ſome think otherwiſe, that the Father, and not Chriſt is called the <hi>only God,</hi> and that <hi>Jude</hi> ſpeaks in <hi>ver.</hi> 4. of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48559:67"/> Jeſus Chriſt afterwards, as diſtinct from the <hi>onely God:</hi> but that it is otherwiſe I prove firſt from the right tranſlation of the Greek; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. that is, <hi>denying the onely God and Maſter, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It is not ſaid the onely God and <hi>the</hi> Maſter (with an article) the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; for then he had ſpoken of two perſons that they denyed, <hi>viz. the onely God,</hi> (that is one) <hi>and the Master, the Lord Jeſus Christ</hi> (that is another:) but it is ſaid, <hi>the onely God</hi> and <hi>Master, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as ſpeaking of one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, only which is <hi>Chriſt.</hi> 2. From the concordance betwixt this Scripture, and that in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1. They are paralell in three particulars, 1. In the title that is put upon Chriſt in both places, he is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which in both places is tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in our Bibles, <hi>Lord;</hi> but is rather to be turned <hi>Maſter.</hi> 2. The crime and fault that is charged upon them is the ſame, it is <hi>denying their Lord,</hi> or <hi>their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</hi> 3. The perſons ſeeme to be the ſame in both places, for they are in all things deſcribed alike, <hi>falſe Teachers</hi> in one place, <hi>filthy dreamers</hi> in the other place: <hi>they privily come in and act and worke</hi> in
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48559:67"/> the one place, <hi>they creep in at unawares</hi> in the other place. <hi>They walke after the fleſh, and deſpiſe government</hi> in one place, <hi>They defile the fleſh, deſpiſe dominion</hi> in the other place. <hi>Their judgement of long time lingreth not, and their damnation ſlumbreth not,</hi> in one place; <hi>and they were before of old ordained to condemnation</hi> in the other place. Their ruine is ſet forth by <hi>the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment which God inflicted upon the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells that fell, and upon the old world, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah in one place; and in the other place <hi>by the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>that fell in the Wilderneſſe by unbeliefe, and by the Apoſtate Angells, and by</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah <hi>and the Cities about them.</hi> So that it ſeems to be one and the ſame Prophecie wherewith both <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Jude</hi> were inſpired, and which they have left upon record for the benefit of the Church: Therefore the one muſt help to expound the other: the crime then of <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying</hi> (which both the Apoſtles ſpeake of) hath the ſame object, <hi>viz.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, and not the Father: it is clear that Chriſt alone is the object of that wicked act of thoſe ſpoken of in <hi>Peter;</hi> therefore Chriſt alone and not the Father, is the object of the ſame wicked act ſpoken of in <hi>Jude.</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:48559:68"/> And indeed there were never any Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Teachers, (and of ſuch both the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſpeake) that did deny the Father to be God, but the Son Jeſus Chriſt was denyed by many. And if we make a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious inſpection into <hi>verſe</hi> 25. of <hi>Jude,</hi> and compare it with the precedent <hi>verſe,</hi> we ſhall find that Chriſt is ſpoken of, and not the Father; and if ſo, then Chriſt is called the <hi>onely wiſe God;</hi> for it is the ſame perſon that preſents ſaints faultleſs before the preſence of his glory, who is called the <hi>onely wiſe God.</hi> But who is that? The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> declares who he is in <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 27. it is Chriſt, who is deſcribed <hi>to give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for the Chuch, and to have waſhed it with his owne bloud, that he may preſent it a glorious Church to himſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whence I thus Argue, If the Father be the <hi>only God,</hi> and if the Son be alſo the <hi>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God,</hi> and yet there are not two <hi>only Gods,</hi> but one <hi>onely God,</hi> then this one <hi>onely God</hi> is both Father and Son; that is, this one <hi>onely God,</hi> though but one in eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, yet is two at leaſt in perſons (but indeed is three, but that is ſomewhat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide my undertaking;) and then it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that that God where an unity one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is granted, both in eſſence and perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:48559:68"/> is not the onely God, which the Goſpel and other Scriptures hold out, and conſequently is a falſe God: for I would ask this queſtion, ſuppoſe a perſon ſhould acknowledge Chriſt to be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God, and ſhould deny the Father to be God, could this man be ſaid to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the one onely true God which the Scriptures ſpeak of? I ſuppoſe none will be ſo abſurd as to aſſert it, therefore if Chriſt be the onely God as the Father is, he that acknowledgeth the Father without him, acknowledgeth not the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true God; and ſo is guilty of deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures, and bringing in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scripture in a maine fundamental point of it.</p>

But for further ſatisfaction, I ſhall propound a 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Argument, which is this; That doctrine which denyes and deſtroyes that one only true Chriſt, and brings in a ſtrange and a falſe Chriſt, that doctrine deſtroyes the true Goſpell and Scriptures, and brings in another Goſpell and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in a main point of it. But this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of his which makes Chriſt a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth thus: therefore this doctrine brings in another Goſpell and Scripture in a main point of it.</p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:48559:69"/>
               <p> The Major is ſo void of controverſie, that it will not be ſtuck at; but the Minor will be denyed, and therefore muſt be confirmed.</p>
               <p>That doctrine that denyes Chriſt to be the proper Son of God, and makes Chriſt to be onely the Son of man, that doctrine denyes and deſtroyes that one only true Chriſt, and brings in a ſtrange and a falſe Chriſt; but this doctrine of his doth thus; therefore this doctrine of his denyes and deſtroyes that onely true Chriſt, and brings in a falſe Chriſt, and ſtrange to Scripture.</p>
               <p>The Major will again paſſe without exception, but proofe will be required for the Minor; And I confirme it thus.</p>
               <p>That doctrine which takes Chriſts God-head from him, that doctrine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies Chriſt to be the proper Son of God, and makes him to be meerly the ſon of man: But this doctrine of his which makes Chriſt to be a meere creature, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, takes Chriſts God-head from him. Therefore this doctrine of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes him to be the proper Son of God, and makes him to be meerely and only the ſon of man.</p>
               <p>The Major wil now only be in queſtion;
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:48559:69"/> for the Minor is (without queſtion) true, if <hi>God-head</hi> be taken in a proper ſenſe, as I have taken it in my arguing with him all along.</p>
               <p>For the proofe then of the Major pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, I ſhall preſent and make out two things, 1. that theſe two things <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Son of God</hi> are all one in reference to Chriſt; therefore whoever teacheth any doctrine againſt the one, <hi>viz.</hi> that Chriſt is <hi>not God,</hi> teacheth doctrine againſt the other, <hi>viz.</hi> that Chriſt is not the <hi>Son of God.</hi> 2. Chriſt cannot be God any other way; or under any other conſideration, but as he is the Son of God.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Son of God</hi> are all one thing in reference to Chriſt: my meaning is not that the termes are confounded, for the word <hi>(God)</hi> reſpects the eſſence, more properly and ſubſiſting in a perſon; and the words <hi>(Son of God)</hi> reſpect the ſecond perſon in the Trinity, as diſtinguiſhed from the Father, and the holy Ghoſt ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in the Godhead. But my meaning is, that where ever the one is expreſſed, the other is implyed, and that a divine perſon ſubſiſting in the Godhead is meant evermore; and in the order of exiſting and working, the ſecond perſon; for proofe
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:48559:70"/> of this, conſider theſe following parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſt himſelf confounds theſe two, <hi>God, and Son of God,</hi> by uſing them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly, <hi>John</hi> 10. 33. 36. In <hi>ver.</hi> 33. the Jewes ſaid they ſtoned him becauſe <hi>he blaſphemed, and ſaid he was God;</hi> Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats their words, and blames them for charging him with blaſphemie, <hi>becauſe he ſaid he was the Son of God, ver.</hi> 36. thoſe were not their expreſſions, but Chriſt makes them their expreſſions, therefore in a ſenſe they were one and the ſame thing, and <hi>Son of God,</hi> was as much as <hi>God,</hi> elſe Chriſt had both extenuated their fault, &amp; ſpoken untruly of them. But in truth and deed Chriſt ſaid of himſelf neither the one nor the other in expreſs words, but ſaid, <hi>he and his Father were one, ver.</hi> 30. and if the <hi>Son of God</hi> did not import as much as God, their collection in their own words that he made himſelfe God, in making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe one with the Father, was more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall in reference to Chriſts words, then as Chriſt repeated them. For the Father is God, and not the Son of God, and when Chriſt ſaid, he and his Father were one, they might rather conclude that Chriſt made himſelfe <hi>God,</hi> then that he
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:48559:70"/> made himſelf <hi>the Son of God,</hi> unleſs the Son of God were alſo <hi>God,</hi> and ſo Chriſt might be the Son of God, and yet one in Godhead with the Father.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 20. makes <hi>the Son of God</hi> and <hi>the true God</hi> to be all one in reference to Chriſt, <hi>You are in him that is true, even in his Son Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> and this <hi>true one,</hi> this <hi>Son Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> this very perſon, <hi>is the true God.</hi> As if the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſhould have ſaid, when I ſpeak of the Son of God, I would have you to know whom I mean by him, I do not mean a man, a meer creature, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but I mean a perſon that is the true God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Apoſtles in their profeſſions of faith, if they do agree therein, (and I ſuppoſe none will ſay that they do diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree therein) do make theſe two to be one and the ſame thing. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> profeſſeth his faith in theſe words, <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that thou art Chriſt the Son of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God.</hi> But the Apoſtle <hi>Thomas</hi> in theſe words, <hi>My Lord, and my God. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> beleeved him to be <hi>the Son of God, Thomas</hi> beleeved him to be <hi>very God,</hi> and <hi>very Lord,</hi> yea <hi>his God</hi> and <hi>his Lord</hi> in an applicative way; and Chriſt doth
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:48559:71"/> not look upon one as two low for him, nor upon the other as too high for him; but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both as profeſſions of their true faith in him; he tells <hi>Peter,</hi> that upon the rock of ſuch a profeſſion he would build his Church; and he puts a bleſſing upon all thoſe that ſhall beleeve as <hi>Thomas</hi> belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, his ſlowneſs only to beleeve (depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon ſight) excepted.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The grounds whereupon the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of Chriſt have ſome of them ſtiled him <hi>the Son of God,</hi> and others of them have ſtiled him <hi>God,</hi> are alike, and high enough (all of them) to cauſe them to entitle him <hi>God. Nathaneel</hi> ſees his om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipreſence and omniſcience, when Chriſt told him, <hi>before Philip called thee, I ſaw thee under the fig tree,</hi> and he glorifies him with the title of <hi>Son of God, Thou art the Son of God. Thomas</hi> diſcerns his omnipotence in raiſing himſelf from the dead, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he had foretold, <hi>deſtroy this temple, and I will raiſe it up in three dayes:</hi> and he attributes the name of <hi>God</hi> to him, <hi>My Lord, and my God.</hi> Had <hi>Thomas</hi> appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended Chriſt to have been paſſive in the reſurrection, and raiſed meerly by the power of the Father, and not his own, why ſhould he denominate him <hi>God</hi> upon this
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:48559:71"/> occaſion? and not rather put that crown upon the Father, that raiſed him, if the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only and not the Son, wrought in it?</p>
               <p n="5">5. The high Prieſts, and Scribes, and Phariſees thought it to be blaſphemy alike in Chriſt when he made himſelf the Son of God, and made God his natural Father, as when he made himſelf God; as they truly collected from thoſe words of his, <hi>I and my Father are one.</hi> Compare <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 18. with <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 31, 33. and the truth of this wil appear. And they made account when he ſtiled himſelf <hi>the Son of God,</hi> that he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in aſſumed to himſelf equality with God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 18. and in that they counted it blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy that he called himſelf <hi>the Son of God,</hi> and judged him worthy to die for it, they diſcovered their apprehenſions of that title, that it was too high for any creature, and proper to the moſt high God alone.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Satan alſo in tempting of him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a proof of his ſon-ſhip unto God, equall and equivalent to what he could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for the manifeſtation of the very God-head it ſelf: and he muſt declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be the Son of God, by doing that which none but God could do.</p>
               <p>Theſe grounds I conceive are ſufficient to bottom the firſt concluſion upon, <hi>viz.</hi> that theſe two expreſſions or titles, <hi>Son of</hi>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:48559:72"/> 
                  <hi>God, and God</hi> are in Scripture account equivalent to each other, and do import when they are applyed to Chriſt a divine perſon, and the ſecond in the order of the Trinity. The conſequence of which is, that who ever denyes the one, denyes the other alſo; and then if the <hi>God-head</hi> of Chriſt be denyed, the Son-ſhip of Chriſt will be denyed alſo.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now lay downe the 2d poſition, and confirme it.</p>
               <p>2 Chriſt cannot be God any other way or under any other conſideration, but as he is the Son of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1 He himſelfe, in his ſenſe, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth the truth of this aſſertion; for, he grants a <hi>God-head</hi> of Chriſt, and makes him a repreſentative God, and ſaith, his <hi>God-head</hi> conſiſts in ſoveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and dominion over all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: and he founds it upon Son-ſhip, and ſaith, the title <hi>Son of God</hi> holds forth ſuperiority over all things, and ſo he is God in that he is the Son of God; but all amounts to no more but a creature God, and a creature Son of God, according to him. Yet he concurrs with me in this propoſition, though in a different ſenſe, Chriſt cannot be God any other way then as he is the Son of God.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:48559:72"/> 2. Scripture gives teſtimony to it. 1. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> declares to us that <hi>God was manifeſted in the fleſh.</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 16. that is, God aſſumed the fleſh of the Virgin; God <hi>took the ſeed of Abraham;</hi> God united our Nature with the Divine Nature; God took it into fellowſhip and oneneſs with himſelf, ſo as that God and man became one and the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And this the Apoſtle calls <hi>a great myſtery,</hi> and founds all godlineſs upon it, that is upon knowing it, and believing it. And ſo Chriſt comes to be God, hath the Names, Titles, Attributes of God put upon him; and the great works of God are called his works; and the homage, worſhip, ſervice, faith, fear, and obedience that is due to God, belongs to him. Otherwiſe it could not have been, that he that appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>the form of a ſervant,</hi> and was <hi>in faſhion as a man,</hi> and <hi>dwelt among us,</hi> and whoſe mother was known who ſhe was, and was <hi>in all things like unto us, ſin excepted,</hi> ſhould be the God that made us, and he in whom our life and breath, and all our ways are: but ſo it was, that the great God emptied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſo far, as to unite himſelf to us, or us rather to himſelf, and to dwell in our nature, and made our nature to dwell in him; and ſo he became one with us, and made us, that is, our Nature, one with him: And ſo the Son of <hi>Mary</hi> is very God, the moſt high God, becauſe God deſcended, and was made fleſh of a woman.</p>
               <p>2. There is a concurrence of witneſſes in the ſacred Scriptures, that God took fleſh; but not God in the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:48559:73"/> perſon of the Father, nor God in the perſon of the Spirit, but God in the perſon of the Son: <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>The Word was made fleſh, and dwelt among us;</hi> and this <hi>Word</hi> is neither the Father, nor the holy Ghoſt, but is diſtinguiſhed from both, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>There are three that bear witneſs in heaven; the Father, the Word and the Spirit; and theſe three are one;</hi> that is, one God. But this one God, in the perſon of the Word, and not in any other perſon, took fleſh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. The Father did not take Fleſh, but ſent the Son to aſſume it: <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>God,</hi> that is, the Father, <hi>ſent forth his Son made of a woman.</hi> Joh. 3. 16. <hi>God,</hi> that is, the Father, <hi>ſo loved the world that he gave his own Son, his onely begotten Son,</hi> &amp;c. And all along in the new Teſtament, the Son is ſaid to be <hi>ſent,</hi> ſometimes from God, ſometimes from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſometimes from heaven: And of the Son it is ſaid in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14, that <hi>he took part of fleſh and blood:</hi> and verſ. 6. <hi>He took on him the ſeed of Abraham:</hi> and of the Son it is ſaid, that <hi>he was in the form of God, and thought it no robbery to be equal with God,</hi> that is, with the Father; <hi>but he humbled himſelf, and took upon him the form of a ſervant;</hi> that is, he took upon him our vile, weak, mortal, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nature, and came in lowe ſtate among us. And indeed, in this there is no difference betwixt us: But who this Son of God is, is the controverſie.</p>
               <p>The inference then muſt needs be this, that Chriſt is not God any other way, nor in any other ſence, but this: The Son of God, or (which is all one) God in the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48559:73"/> perſon of the Son aſſumed Humane nature unto him, became Man, by taking the fleſh of the Virgin. And this Son of God, or God in the perſon of the Son made fleſh, is the Chriſt, the Meſſiah, that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to the fathers: And Chriſt, he is this fleſh this ſeed of the woman, aſſumed, and this Son of God, or God in the perſon of the Son, united together into one perſon. So that whoever denies Chriſt to be God, denies that God in the perſon of the Son; or (which is the ſame) that the Son of God took fleſh came in our Nature; and that God ſent his Son into the world, to take the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> upon him, and to come in fleſh; and ſo denies Chriſt to be God in the perſon of the Son, or Chriſt to be the Son of God. And ſo by an undeniable conſequence, ſuch a perſon who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the Godhead, denies the Sonſhip, and ſo deſtroys the true Chriſt, and brings in a ſtrange and a falſe Chriſt, and another Goſpel, and another Scripture. And this is the doctrine that the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of, 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. which ſeducers preached, who confeſſed not that Jeſus Chriſt was come in the fleſh: the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is they confeſſed not that the Son of God or God in the perſon of the Son, was come in the fleſh: for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they knew that Jeſus Chriſt the ſon of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> was in the fleſh, and died, and roſe again: But to confeſs that Jeſus was the Son of God, or God in the perſon of the Son, was that which the Apoſtle preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and withſtood the contrary, as Antichriſtian, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 14, 15.</p>
               <p>And now give me leave to expreſs my ſelf to
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:48559:74"/> be one who ſtand amazed at the ignorance or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderateneſs (or I know not what to call it) of thoſe perſons who profeſs to be very ſound in the doctrine of Chriſts Godhead, but conceive of it as a very to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable errour, in ſuch who do deny it, and make ſlight of it. Is it a ſmall thing to deny Chriſt to be the Son of God? Thoſe that deny Chriſts Godhead, do deny God in the perſon of the Son, to have taken the nature of man upon him: or, they do deny the Son of God to be incarnate, and by conſequence they do deny Chriſt to be Gods Son. For do they not know, (I ſpeak of thoſe that have not denied the Faith) if Chriſt be God, he can be God no other way, but becauſe God in the perſon of the Son, or the Son of God, took fleſh upon him: if Chriſt be Gods Son, he can be Gods Son no other way, but becauſe God in the perſon of the Son hath come in the fleſh; and if this be denied, it is denied that Chriſt is Gods Son. And is this a trivial matter? Chriſt conſiſts of two Natures; of Humanity, and ſo he is the Son of man; of the Deity, and ſo he is the Son of God, as I have ſhewed. Can Chriſt be a true Chriſt, if either of theſe be wanting? A Man conſiſts of ſoul and body: if either of theſe be wanting, can he be a true man? If the ſoul be wanting, (which is the principal part) is he any more then a ſtinking carcaſe?) If Chriſt be not the Son of God, (as, if he be not God, he is not) is he any other but a carcaſe-Chriſt? Can a thing have its truth of being, without its conſtitutive parts by which it is? So that Chriſt is deſtroyed,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48559:74"/> unlels the Son of God, and the Son of Man, united together in one perſon, be maintained.</p>
               <p>I now come to preſent and drive on a third Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is this:</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="part">
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. That Doctrine which deſtroys the true Faith of Chriſtians, and brings in another Faith, a ſtrange and falſe Faith; that Doctrine deſtroys the true Goſpel and Scripture, and brings in another Goſpel and Scripture, in a main Point.</p>
               <p>But this Doctrine of his, which makes Chriſt a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, doth ſo:</p>
               <p>Therefore, this Doctrine of his deſtroys the true Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel and Scripture, and brings in another and a falſe Goſpel and Scripture.</p>
               <p>The Major is indubitable; the Minor may be thus proved:</p>
               <p>That Doctrine which takes away the principal object of a Chriſtians Faith, doth deſtroy the true Faith of a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>But this Doctrine of his, which makes Chriſt a meer creature, doth take away the principal object of the Faith of a Chriſtian:</p>
               <p>Therefore, this Doctrine of his doth deſtroy the Faith of a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>The Major cannot reaſonably be denied, becauſe Faith is true and ſaving from the object that it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant about; as ſuppoſe it ſhould be <hi>Baal</hi> in ſtead of the true God; ſuppoſe it ſhould be <hi>Mahomet</hi> in ſtead of Chriſt; or ſuppoſe it ſhould be a falſe or counterfeit Chriſt, in ſtead of the true Chriſt: that
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:48559:75"/> faith that is carried out to ſuch an object, could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be true nor ſaving.</p>
               <p>The Minor may be thus confirmed:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>That Doctrine that denies Chriſt to be the Son of God takes away the principal object of the faith of Chriſtians.</item>
                  <item>But this Doctrine of his, which makes whole Chriſt a creature doth deny Chriſt to be the Son of God:</item>
                  <item>Therefore, this Doctrine takes away the principal object of the faith of Chriſtians.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The Major hath an infallible truth in it: for the Scripture makes Chriſt to be principally the object of a Chriſtians faith, as he is the Son of God. 1. It hath its denomination from this object; it is called <hi>the faith of the Son of God</hi> Gal. 2. 20. 2. Chriſt propoſeth himſelf, as he is the Son of God, to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved on: ſo to the blinde man (whoſe eyes he had opened) <hi>Doſt thou believe the Son of God,</hi> ſaid Chriſt? <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 35. Under that conſideration, as ſuch a perſon he preſented himſelf as an adequate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his faith for ſalvation. 3. The primitive Saints mentioned in Scripture, in their Confeſſions of Faith, do point their Faith, and terminate it upon Chriſt, the Son of God. In <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. 27, <hi>Martha</hi> ſaid, <hi>Lord, I believe that thou art Chriſt the Son of God.</hi> The Eunuch alſo being put upon the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his faith, did pitch it upon, and carried it out to this object, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 37. <hi>I believe that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God.</hi> It ſhould ſeem that <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> had held him forth in the excellency and glory of
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:48559:75"/> his perſon <hi>as the Son of God,</hi> and had preached him under that relation as the object of ſaving faith, and that thereupon the Eunuch received him as ſuch, and believed. But before theſe, the Apoſtles themſelves, that were bred up under Chriſt, and were inſtructed by Chriſt, they grounded their faith upon Chriſt as he was the Son of the living God, in <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 69. <hi>We believe and are ſure that thou art Chriſt the Son of the living God.</hi> 4. Chriſt makes himſelf, as he is <hi>the Son of God,</hi> the foundation of Chriſtians, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which their faith muſt bottom; and this Article of Faith, <hi>Thou art Chriſt the Son of the living God,</hi> he makes the Rock upon which he will build his <hi>Church;</hi> and the gates of hell ſhall never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 16. And he placeth true bleſſedneſs in it. I could wiſh that all perſons that are right in their opinion of Chriſts Godhead, and yet plead againſt the fundamentalneſs of the errour of denying the Godhead, would but ponder what is here preſented, and take it up in its full weight and ſtrength. They that hold Chriſt to be God, muſt needs do it upon this account, becauſe God in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Son, or the Son of God, which is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond perſon in the Trinity, took fleſh upon him, and became man; and that hence it is that this man, and this ſecond perſon in the Godhead, or this Son of God, make up one Chriſt, and that Chriſt is hereupon juſtly ſtiled <hi>the Son of God,</hi> or <hi>the ſecond perſon in the Godhead.</hi> And if it be alſo clear from Scripture, that faith in Chriſt is onely ſound and ſaving, as it
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:48559:76"/> hath Chriſt conſidered as he is the Son of God, or the ſecond perſon in the Godhead, for the object of it; then what can that Doctrine be leſs then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructively dangerous, and ſubverting the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Chriſtianity, that denies that there is any ſuch God in the perſon of the Son, or any ſuch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond perſon in the Godhead called the Son, or that there is any ſuch Son of God, who is God; ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons conſequently cannot have their Faith carried out after any ſuch Son of God, who is God, but after a Creature-ſon of God, which is totally another thing from that Son of God which Scripture preſents to us: And what can be thought of thoſe that hold ſuch Doctrine, but that they have left the Rock, the Foundation upon which Believers are built unto the ſalvation of their ſouls; and that they build upon the ſand, and that their ſtate threatens certain ruine?</p>
               <p>But the Minor will be that Propoſition which he will deny; <hi>viz.</hi> That this Doctrine of his which makes whole Chriſt a creature, doth deny Chriſt to be the Son of God.</p>
               <p>I have proved this Propoſition in my proſecution of the former Argument; to which I might refer the Reader: but for further ſatisfaction I ſhall make choice of another <hi>medium,</hi> and by it prove that this his Doctrine denies Chriſt to be the Son of God.</p>
               <p>That Doctrine that makes Chriſt a creature-ſon of God, denies Chriſt to be the true Son of God.</p>
               <p>But this Doctrine of his makes Chriſt to be onely a creature-ſon of God:</p>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:48559:76"/>
               <p> Therefore this Doctrine of his denies Chriſt to be the true Son of God.</p>
               <p>The Major Propoſition is that which will onely be denied by him; therefore I ſhall prove out of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that Chriſt cannot be a creature-ſon of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The eternal Son of God cannot be a creature-ſon of God, becauſe no creature is eternal. Or thus:</p>
               <p>That Son of God that hath neither <hi>beginning of days, nor end of life,</hi> cannot be a creature-ſon of God, becauſe it is the moſt high God's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty to be without beginning or ending.</p>
               <p>But Chriſt is ſuch a Son of God, which is without beginning of days, and hath no end of life; which is evident from <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 3. <hi>Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dek</hi> is deſcribed to have neither <hi>beginning of days, nor end of life;</hi> and therein (as a type onely) to be like the Son of God, or like Ghriſt as he is the Son of God: by which it appears, that Chriſt is ſuch a Son of God as is truely eternal, without beginning or ending. For it behoves that which is the Antitype, or the thing typified, to be that in truth, which the Type is in ſhadow. <hi>Melchizedek</hi> was in figure and in myſterie without beginning of days and end of life; Chriſt muſt therefore really and truely be without beginning and end, becauſe he, as the Son of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was the perſon whom <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek</hi> typified herein.</p>
               <p>Therefore, he is no creature-ſon of God.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:48559:77"/> 2. The Almighty Son of God cannot be a creature-ſon of God, becauſe <hi>Almightineſs</hi> is one of the moſt high God's incommunicable attributes.</p>
               <p>But Chriſt is ſuch a Son of God as is Almighty:</p>
               <p>Therefore, no creature-ſon of God.</p>
               <p>That Chriſt is ſuch a Son of God as is God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, will be proved from Scripture. In <hi>Mat.</hi> 14. 32. 33, conſidered with the context, the windes were boiſterous and tempeſtous: by the vertue and power of Chriſt, (which was inherent in him, and which he was the ſubject of) they ceaſed. Hereupon, the diſciples all of them worſhipped him, and confeſſed that he was the Son of God, that is, one Almighty, whom the windes and the ſea obeyed; and this they made to be the Son of God: for they apprehended the Son of God to be ſuch an one who was cloathed with ſuch power. So in <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 33, 34, <hi>John</hi> knew not Chriſt who he was; but the Father told him that he <hi>on whom the holy Ghoſt ſhould deſcend, ſhould baptize with the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Hence <hi>John</hi> collected, that he was the Son of God; and the text ſaith, <hi>he bare record of it.</hi> God had not told him ſo, but onely that <hi>he ſhould baptize with the holy Ghoſt;</hi> but he thence collected ſo much. But how could that be, ſeeing the diſciples baptized with the holy Ghoſt; and yet it could not be collected that they were each of them the Son of God in the ſence that <hi>John</hi> bare record of Chriſt, that he was the Son-of God? It muſt be conceived then, that <hi>John</hi> look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Chriſt as one in whom the power was inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:48559:77"/> baptize with the holy Ghoſt, and that he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued after this manner. He in whom the vertue, is to baptize with the holy Ghoſt; that is, he who hath the power of enabling men to ſpeak with ſtrange tongues, and to propheſie, and to work miraculouſly, he muſt needs be the Son of God. But Chriſt is ſuch an one: Therefore, he is the Son of God. The Son of God which <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of, is therefore an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Son of God, and no creature, becauſe he can do ſuch a thing, that requireth an Almighty power. In like manner we may read in <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 25. Chriſt ſaith, that <hi>the dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God, and that they that hear it ſhall live.</hi> This Son of God then can be no creature, becauſe the dead in any ſence cannot hear the voice of a creature. It is not to be denied, but that men have raiſed the dead, in what ſence ſoever it may be taken, who are but creatures: but it was not the outward voice which raiſed them, and which they heard, which external voice is the creatures voice; but it was the power that they felt, which was God's, which is called the <hi>voice behinde them,</hi> or within them, and is nothing but the power of God in working upon them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 21. But the voice by the force of which theſe dead which Chriſt ſpeaks of were to be raiſed, was the voice of the Son of God; it was Chriſt's own voice, Chriſt's own power, by which they were to be raiſed; elſe Chriſt declared neither any new thing, nor ſtrange thing, to cauſe them to believe on him, becauſe many others as inſtruments might utter ſuch a voice. And the
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:48559:78"/> following verſe clears it, that by the voice of the Son of God, the power of the Son of God is meant: <hi>As the Father</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>hath life in himſelf, ſo hath he given to the Son to have life in himſelf.</hi> The meaning is, that as the Father is the living God, and hath life in himſelf eſſentially, and is the root of life, to quicken the dead that are without life: ſo the Son hath life in himſelf eſſentially, and is the principle of life to others that are dead, and want it. And if this were not ſo, there could not be the ſtrength of a Reaſon to confirm the foregoing verſe. Chriſt had ſaid, <hi>They that hear the voice of the Son of God, ſhall live.</hi> How doth he prove it? Thus: <hi>As the Father hath life in himſelf;</hi> that is, As the Father is all life, eſſentially life, and the principle of life, to quicken whom he will by his mighty power: ſo the Son hath life in himſelf, (though it be communicated with his eſſence by eternal generation, which is ſutable to a Son) and is eſſentially life, all life, and nothing elſe; and is the principle of life, quickning, by that life in himſelf, whom he will. I ſhall preſent one Scripture more, in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>For this purpoſe the Son of God was manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the works of the devil.</hi> This phraſe, <hi>the Son of God was manifeſted,</hi> is a parallel-phraſe with that in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>God manifeſted in the fleſh.</hi> This God was God in the perſon of the Son, who was manifeſted in the fleſh, that is, took the fleſh of a Virgin upon him, and became man. For what end? The Apoſtle ſhews, <hi>that he might deſtroy</hi> (that is,
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:48559:78"/> in man's nature might do it) <hi>the works of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi> The Son of God deſtroyed; but by whoſe power deſtroyed he the works of the devil? By his own power: he is called one that is <hi>ſtronger</hi> then the devil, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 12. And if it had not been done by his own power, there was no neceſſity that the Son of God ſhould have been manifeſted in the fleſh for that purpoſe: for the Son of man might have done it as an Inſtrument, as the Diſciples caſt out de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils; (which was one of the works of Satan that was deſtroyed; his work was to poſſeſs bodies, as well as ſouls; and he was caſt out; which was the deſtruction of that work:) but the vertue by which they caſt out, was none of theirs, but Chriſts; but Chriſt's vertue was his own: for, as one ſtronger, he ſpoiled Satan of all he had, and deſtroyed all his works; wherein the Almightineſs of Chriſt is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt. And ſo it appears that Chriſt is ſuch a Son of God that is Almighty, and ſo conſequently no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-ſon.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>3. That Son of God that is omniſcient, or all-knowing, cannot be a creature-ſon of God.</item>
                  <item>But Chriſt is ſuch a Son of God that is omniſcient and all knowing:</item>
                  <item>Therefore, he is not a creature-ſon of God.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The Major is clear, becauſe Omniſciencie is like Omnipotencie; it is incommunicable to the creature, being one of Gods attributes.</p>
               <p>The Minor may be proved from <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 18, 23. The words are: <hi>Thus ſaith the Son of God, who</hi>
                  <pb n="558" facs="tcp:48559:79"/> 
                  <hi>hath his eyes like a flame of fire,</hi> that is, to give light to him in all the world, by which he may ſee all things. Therefore it is added. <hi>And all the Churches ſhall know that I am he that ſearcheth the heart, and trieth the reins, and giveth to every one according to his works.</hi> Chriſt ſpeaketh of himſelf, as the Son of God, and ſhews what a Son he is; ſuch a Son that is equal to his Father, who can ſearch as deep, and inward, and hidden things as the Father can: he hath his Fathers eyes, his Fathers knowledge, wiſdom, and underſtanding. It is the one onely God's priviledge and prerogative, to ſearch the heart, as I have proved from <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 9, 10. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; and yet Chriſt as the Son of God, doth it: Therefore he is no creature-ſon, but ſuch a Son as is the one onely God alſo.</p>
               <p>The fourth Argument, that carries on the ſame deſigne, <hi>viz.</hi> tends to prove this Doctrine of his againſt the Godhead of Chriſt to be deſtructive to the Goſpel in ſome main point of it, is this:</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="argument">
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. The Doctrine that ſubverts and deſtroys true Baptiſm, and brings in a falſe and unſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptural Baptiſm, that Doctrine deſtroys the true Goſpel and Scripture, and brings in another Goſpel and Scripture in a main point of it.</p>
               <p>But this Doctrine of his, which makes whole Chriſt a creature, ſubverts and deſtroys true Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm:</p>
               <p>Therefore, this Doctrine of his deſtroys the true Goſpel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="559" facs="tcp:48559:79"/>
               <p> The Major cannot be gainſaid, becauſe Baptiſm is numbered among the higheſt Fundamentals of the Scripture, to be believed; the denying of which, will deſtroy, if any thing will deſtroy: <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 5, 6. <hi>One Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm; one God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all.</hi> And it is called a <hi>principle,</hi> Heb. 6. 1, 2. And becauſe the fruit of Chriſt's death, which ſtands in remiſſion of ſins, is the myſtical and ſpiritual part of Baptiſm, <hi>Acts</hi> 22. 16. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21.</p>
               <p>The Minor Propoſition may be thus corroborated and confirmed.</p>
               <p>That Doctrine that brings in a Baptiſm which is into the Name of a meer creature, ſubverts and deſtroys true Scriptural Baptiſm, and brings in a falſe unſcriptural Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>But this Doctrine of his, which makes whole Chriſt a creature, doth bring in or ſet up a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm which is into the Name of a meer crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Therefore, this Doctrine of his ſubverts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys true Scriptural Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>I ſhall ſtrengthen both Propoſitions, becauſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he will deny both; and will begin with the proof of the Major, <hi>viz.</hi> that to baptize into the Name of a meer creature, deſtroys true Baptiſm, and ſets up a falſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the true Scriptural Baptiſm is the Seal of a Covenant, betwixt that one true God, and the believer that partakes of it; in which the believer conſecrates and gives up himſelf to believe on, and
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:48559:80"/> be ſervant to the true God: God and the believer are the confederates. The believer is not confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with any creature: As he gives not himſelf up to the creature, ſo neither can any creature accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh for him thoſe great bleſſings of the Covenant; but he depends upon God alone for them. The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant which is ſealed, is the Covenant of Grace, by which we are ſaved.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe true Goſpel-Baptiſm is the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Adoption, which reſpects the true God alone: for in Baptiſm, the Name of God is named upon the believer, and the believer carries God's Name upon him. And this the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> doth point at, when he reproves the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for calling themſelves by the name of <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaying, <hi>I am of Paul.</hi> The Argument that he makes uſe of againſt them, is this: <hi>Were you baptized into the name of Paul?</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid; His Name ye bear, and his children ye are, into whoſe Name ye were baptized: but were ye baptized into the name of <hi>Paul,</hi> that you will carry his name? No, ye were not; but into the Name of God, to note out your adoption to God. To be adopted, and to be the ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Almighty, is all one, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 18. And we are not adopted into ſonſhip to any creature: that is unſcriptural doctrine, and not to be received.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe true Goſpel-Baptiſm is the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of the believers ſubjection unto Divine Soveraignty, or the authority of the moſt high God: for by <hi>Name,</hi> Authority is frequently underſtood:
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48559:80"/> to do a thing in the Name of any Prince, or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, or State, is to do in the Vertue, Power, and Authority of them; and to baptize in the Name, is to baptize in the Authority of God, whoſe Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance it is, and from whom the bleſſing muſt come.</p>
               <p>And for ſuch-like reaſons as theſe, it was, that the Apoſtle ſhunned and declined baptizing into his own name: he looked upon it as ſacrilegious to God, and an uſurping upon God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 14, 15. <hi>I thank God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I baptized none of you, ſave Criſpus and Gaius, leſt any ſhould ſay that I ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized into mine own name.</hi> Thus jealous was <hi>Paul,</hi> leſt he ſhould aſſume and arrogate to himſelf that which is the prerogative of, and is proper to God.</p>
               <p>The Minor Propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> That this Doctrine of his, which makes whole Chriſt a creature, doth bring in, and ſet up, a Baptiſm which is into the name of a meer creature, carries evidence in it ſelf, becauſe Baptiſm is an Ordinance that (without contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) is into the Name of Chriſt, and conſequently into the name of a meer creature, if whole Chriſt be a creature.</p>
               <p>Object.</p>
               <p>All that (I can foreſee) can be alleadged by him againſt this, is, That Baptiſm is principally into the Name of the Father; and that it is through Chriſt, as an inſtrument through whom the Father doth beſtow the bleſſings of Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> But, 1. How doth Scripture juſtifie this? where doth it give witneſs to it? If not, it is not
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:48559:81"/> derogatory to Chriſt to imagine it. 2. Why doth Chriſt joyn himſelf and the Spirit with the Father, as three aſſociates, without any ſhadow of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or diſparity; whoſe Perſons are three, but whoſe Name is but one? It is not ſaid, Names, but Name: for as their Eſſence is one, ſo their Name is one; as they are one Lord, ſo their Name is one. 3. Baptiſm hath been into the Name of the Lord Jeſus alone, without the mention of the Father at all, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 5. <hi>When they heard this, they were baptized into the Name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm did run in ſuch a form, as that ſometimes the Name of Chriſt was onely uſed, and the Father and the holy Ghoſt were wholly ſilenced, but never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. And can it be conceived, that if the Name of the Father be the Name of that perſon which is principal, and the Name of the Son be the Name of a perſon that is onely inſtrumental, that in the form of Baptiſm, or words of inſtitution, the Name of the principal perſon ſhould be pretermitted, and and the name of the Name of the inſtrument men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned? There is neither Sence, nor Reaſon, nor Pattern, nor Example for it.</p>
               <p>Object.</p>
               <p>But it may be objected, That <hi>Moſes</hi> was but an inſtrument in that Baptiſm of <hi>the cloud<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and of the <hi>ſea,</hi> that is ſpoken of in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2. and yet it is ſaid, that <hi>they were all baptized into Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, in the cloud, and in the ſea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol. Moſes</hi> is not to be conſidered as an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but as a Type of Chriſt, who was preſent
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:48559:81"/> with the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the pillar of the cloud, and in the pillar of fire: and they were baptized into <hi>Moſes</hi> myſtically, and figuratively, as into the Type; but really and truely they were baptized in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, who was the Antitype, and in whom that which was in ſhadow in reference to <hi>Moſes,</hi> was in ſubſtance, and was fulfilled, in reference unto Chriſt, as hath been demonſtrated before.</p>
               <p>For further conviction, becauſe I diſcern that ſome are <hi>ſlowe of heart to believe</hi> the deſperateneſs and damnableneſs of this Doctrine, I ſhall propound another Argument to prove the deſtructiveneſs of this his Tenent to the Goſpel, and Scriptures, in ſome main points of them.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="5" type="argument">

               <p>But this Doctrine of his, which makes whole Chriſt a creature, doth deny and deſtroy the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie of Chriſt as a Saviour:</p>
               <p>Therefore, this Doctrine of his doth deny and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Goſpel, and whole Scripture, not onely in a main point, but in the main ſcope of them.</p>
               <p>The Major Propoſition will be readily confeſſed by him, and denied by none; therefore needs no proof.</p>
               <p>The Minor Propoſition muſt be fortified, elſe it will be challenged as ſlanderous.</p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:48559:82"/>
               <p> I therefore prove it by a double <hi>medium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That Doctrine that denies Chriſt to be the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of ſalvation, and makes him an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment onely in the hand of him that is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; that Doctrine denies Chriſt to be a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Saviour.</p>
               <p>But this Doctrine of his, which makes whole Chriſt a creature, doth deny Chriſt to be the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of ſalvation, and makes him onely an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument in the hand of the Father, who is the author:</p>
               <p>Therefore, this Doctrine of his denies Chriſt to be a ſufficient Saviour.</p>
               <p>He may perhaps deny the Major, and diſtinguiſh of ſufficiencie, and ſay there is an abſolute and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent ſufficiencie, which is proper to that which is the author of a thing; and there is a limited and reſtrained ſufficiencie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> depending upon that abſolute ſufficiencie of the author, which is ſutable and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to an inſtrument; and this later Chriſt hath, and ſo is ſufficient through God, through the Father, for the work of ſalvation, though he be but a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>But ſuch an Anſwer muſt be judged weak, for two Reaſons. 1. The ſufficiencie of Chriſt to ſave, is an abſolute ſufficiencie, and ſuch as is proper to the author of ſalvation, according to the teſtimony of the Scripture, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>And being made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, he became the author of eternal ſalvation to them that obey him.</hi> Now I hope he will not
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:48559:82"/> confound the Author and the Inſtrument, and make them one perſon. An inſtrumental ſufficiencie the Scripture knows nothing of, in reference to Chriſt, nor doth attribute any ſuch to him. 2. An inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental ſufficiencie is no other then inſufficiencie: for an inſtrument is not able to ſave to the utmoſt, and ſo is of himſelf inſufficient to ſave; but Chriſt is able of himſelf to <hi>ſave to the utmoſt,</hi> Heb. 7. 25.</p>
               <p>But he perhaps will endeavour to evade the ſtrength of this Aſſertion, by ſaying, that if Chriſt be able, through God the Father, to ſave to the utmoſt, it is ſufficient for the verifying of Scripture.</p>
               <p>But neither hath this Anſwer ſtrength in it, nor is Scripture verified by it: for Scripture ſpeaks of Chriſts ability, as ability in himſelf; <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3, Chriſt is deſcribed to be one that <hi>upholds all things by the word of his</hi> own <hi>power,</hi> and to purge ſin away by <hi>himſelf:</hi> and Chriſt never needed to ſay of the Father, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>I am able to do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthneth me;</hi> ſo Chriſt, I am able to do all things through the Father that ſtrengthens me: and though he might be ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened, as the Son of man, yet not as the Son of God; but drew on the people to believe a Divine power in himſelf: for his words are without any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation. <hi>Doſt thou believe that I am able to do this for thee?</hi> ſaith he to one that came to be cured of him, without interpoſing any words which ſhould ſhew his dependence on another. And this ability was Divine ability, becauſe it lay in this, <hi>viz.</hi> to
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:48559:83"/> heal without the efficacie of means which might conduce to ſuch a purpoſe. And Chriſt is called <hi>the power of the Father,</hi> becauſe the Father's power is in him. And it is ſaid that God <hi>laid help upon one that is mighty;</hi> which, though ſpoken of <hi>David,</hi> yet of him but as the Type; and is meant of Chriſt, who is the Antitype, and who is truely mighty. This ability of Chriſt within himſelf to ſave to the utmoſt, is that which the Apoſtle diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for, in many places of that Epiſtle, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Context of that Scripture, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. <hi>He is able to ſave to the utmoſt:</hi> for he doth detect the inſufficiencie of the High-prieſt to ſave, by ſhewing their mortality, and other infirmities; and then preſents Chriſt's ſufficiencie. And if it were ſo that God could have ſaved by an inſtrument which derives his vertue from him, and is dependent upon him, a Saviour needed not to have come from heaven; for God might have done it by any earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly creature, or by any creature-inſtrument, without any reſpect had to power or ability as inherent in it at all, but by his own power manifeſted by it; and ſo might have ſaved by an Apoſtle, equally as by a Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall prove what I deſigne, by another <hi>medium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That Doctrine which renders Chriſt inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to the work of ſaving, renders him an inſufficient Saviour, or deſtroys his ſufficiencie as a Saviour.</p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:48559:83"/>
               <p> But this Doctrine of his renders Chriſt inſufficient to perform the work of ſaving, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which I prove thus:</p>
               <p>If Chriſt be a meer creature, he is inſufficient to execute thoſe three Offices of King, Prieſt, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, to perform the work which thoſe Offices do call for, for the ſaving of men.</p>
               <p>I ſhall begin with his Prophetical Office, unto the execution of which it is neceſſary, not onely to open the Scriptures to men, that they may conceive of them, but to open the underſtandings of men to underſtand them; and to give them eye-ſalve, that they may ſee: which, becauſe it belongs to his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice as a Prophet, he muſt be able to do from vertue and ability within himſelf. But no creature can ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect this by any power of its own, nor is capable to receive ſuch power from another, becauſe it is not competent to the creature; and conſequently, Chriſt being onely a creature (as he holds him) is diſabled in the principal work of that Office.</p>
               <p>And, as a Prieſt, he was to offer up himſelf to God through the eternal Spirit, that he might purge away ſin, and that his Blood might be of greater efficacie then the blood of bulls and goats; and that he might purchaſe eternal redemption for believers: which as a creature he could not do, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 12. So that he diſables him in the works of his Prieſtly Office, in holding him onely to be a creature.</p>
               <p>And, as a King, he muſt conquer Death, by raiſing
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:48559:84"/> himſelf up from the dead, which he was to ſuffer as a Prieſt, to take away ſin. And he muſt alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy ſin in its regnancie by Kingly power, in his members, as he was to condemn it in its guilt by his death: which work is above the power of any meer creature. So that by this opinion of his, he is made weak to perform all his Offices, which yet he came into the world to accompliſh; and that he is made an inſufficient Saviour; which overturns the Goſpel, in the principal ſcope of it. But of this more hereafter.</p>
               <p>The laſt Argument which I ſhall now produce to prove another Goſpel and Scripture to be brought in, and the true Goſpel and Scripture to be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is this:</p>

               <p>But this Doctrine of his ſerves to overturn and deſtroy the myſtery of godlineſs:</p>

               <p>The Major Propoſition he will not have the boldneſs to make queſtion of.</p>

               <p>That which is predicated or declared of this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, is that it is a <hi>myſtery of godlineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Great is the myſtery</hi>] It is one of the great depths of God; it is the depth of depths, the head and height of all myſteries; which <hi>eye hath not ſeen,</hi> and <hi>ear hath not heard,</hi> and which <hi>hath not entred into the heart of man to conceive;</hi> which fleſh and blood hath not revealed, but the Father that is in heaven by the Spirit; <hi>viz.</hi> that God in the perſon of the Son, was ſent by the Father, and by conſent with the Father, gave himſelf to a ſtate of debaſement, humbled himſelf, and appeared in the faſhion of a man by taking fleſh of the Virgin, and becoming together with it one perſon, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, God-man; God in the perſon of the Son, and the Son of man, making one Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This truth was witneſſed by the Spirit, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Divinity of the ſecond perſon made fleſh, by ſome glory of the Godhead of the Son, which in fleſh appeared, and declared him to be what he was; and teſtified by the attendance of Angels, and preached, and believed by all ſorts of men whom God hath ordained to life and ſealed to the ſatisfaction of all that might doubt, by his aſſumption into glory; Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah the Father therein ſpeaking to Jehovah the Son, <hi>Sit thou at my right hand, till I make thine</hi>

                  <hi>enemies thy foot ſtool.</hi> Some ſuch enemies were thoſe which contradicted him, and called it blaſphemy, when he ſaid that he was the Son of God, or God in the perſon of the Son; which is all one. <hi>This</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>is the great myſtery</hi> which is tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent above all reaſon in the ſons of men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of godlineſs</hi>] This is that truth, in the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of which, and in the aſſent to which, all godlineſs is founded and bottomed: For it is the Goſpel in the grand myſtery of it, <hi>the Son in fleſh,</hi> that being preached to the world, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by faith, becomes the ſeed of all piety and godlineſs, by which we are begotten to God, and are made partakers of the Divine nature. This my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Chriſt revealed, forms Chriſt in the hearts of thoſe to whom it is revealed. This Doctrine known and believed, changeth men into the ſame image; that as the eternal Son of God in fleſh is become man-like, ſo they (after they have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged it by faith) are made God-like: for therein is the rich grace and glorious mercy of the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed. The love of the Father is tranſcendent in glory, in giving ſuch a Son, who is the expreſs image of himſelf, and the ſame God eſſentially with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: And the love of the Son is ſuperlative, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all the conceptions of the ſons of men, in giving himſelf, when it is rightly underſtood that this <hi>Self</hi> whom he gives is God bleſſed for ever.</p>
               <p>This truth believed, works aſtoniſhment, and the ſoul is raviſhed with the thoughts of it. But the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:48559:86"/> other, <hi>viz.</hi> God's giving a Creature for us, and a Creature's giving it ſelf for us, is a lowe buſineſs, in compariſon of this: nor can the heart be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, in apprehenſion of the love of God, nor can it be ſo inflamed with love to God; but this myſtery (as the Apoſtle lays it down) quickens faith &amp; love, and heightens them; which graces are the chariots to carry the ſoul out to all godlineſs and honeſty.</p>
               <p>The conſequence of which is, Whoever denies this myſtery, denies and deſtroys godlineſs, and, in ſo doing, denies and deſtroys the Goſpel, which is called by the Apoſtle, <hi>doctrine which is after god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 3. Tit. 1. 1.</p>
               <p>And this is of weighty conſideration to all thoſe that acknowledge Chriſt to be God, and yet hold it not very dreadful in thoſe that do gainſay it, but account them Saints and godly perſons: which they cannot groundedly do, while the evidence of this text is againſt them, which ſaith. <hi>Great is the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of godlineſs, God manifeſt in the fleſh.</hi> And if they acknowledge the truth of this text, then this text will ſtare them in the face, while they cry up the godlineſs of ſuch who do oppoſe it. Where is their godlineſs, if this myſterie (which they acknowledge not) be the myſterie of godlineſs? If godlineſs be the fruit of this doctrine, rightly underſtood &amp; received; if it grow upon the tree of this truth, and they hew down this tree, deſtroy this truth in the opinion which they hold; doth not the fruit fall with it? Godlineſs is cut down with the tree out of which it grows; it is
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:48559:86"/> plucked up with the root that bears it. What can be ſaid againſt this? Me thinks every tongue ſhould be ſilent hence-forward, that ſubſcribes to this text, <hi>Great is the myſtery of golineſs, God manifeſt in the fleſh,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But enough hath been ſpoken of this, to convince any one that loves the Truth, and will open his eyes to receive it.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now undertake the maintaining of ſuch Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments or Inſtances (as he calls them) which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to ſhew the repugnancie of his Doctrine to the Goſpel, and to the Scripture, and diſcover the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and unſoundneſs of the Anſwers that he gives.</p>
               <p>The firſt Argument or Inſtance, was:</p>
            </div>
            <div n="1" type="instance">
               <p>
                  <hi>Inſtance</hi> 1. If Chriſt be but a meer creature, and not God, then the giving of Divine worſhip, and honour, and ſervice to a meer creature, is lawful, and warrantable; which yet is everywhere forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, in reference to any creature, but is practiſed unto Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 12, 13, 14. and would be ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, if Chriſt were not God.</p>
               <p>He puts this Inſtance into form.</p>
               <p>To give Divine worſhip, honour and ſervice to a meer creature, is contrary to the Scripture.</p>
               <p>To give Divine worſhip, honour, and ſervice to Chriſt, is not contrary to, but by the warrant of Scripture:</p>
               <p>Therefore, Chriſt is not a meer creature.</p>
               <p>He anſwers to the Major Propoſition, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſheth of Divine worſhip, honour, and ſervice.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:48559:87"/> Firſt, (he ſaith) <hi>All worſhip and honour which of right belongs to any creature, is in ſome ſence di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, God being the principal author, and ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate centre thereof,</hi> Rom. 13. &amp; Eph. 6. 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> But he might as truely ſay, Every war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable action that a man performs, is divine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath God for the principal Author, and ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Centre; that is, it hath God's command for the beginning of it, and God's glory for the end of of it. But by ſuch diſtinguiſhing, he confounds what ought to be diſtinguiſhed; he makes Divine worſhip and Civil worſhip to be the ſame thing, becauſe God is the principal Author and ultimate Centre of them both: but theſe two have ever been diſtinguiſhed by our Writers, and made oppoſite <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Worſhip. Therefore it was very frivolous for him to look upon Divine Worſhip in that ſence.</p>
               <p>2. He ſaith, <hi>But if you mean, in the ſtricteſt ſence, that worſhip, honour and ſervice which is peculiar to the moſt high God; then I ſhall ſay with you that it is Idolatry; and contrary to the Scriptures, to give it to any creature whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> The controverſie betwixt us and the Papiſts, is, what Worſhip is peculiar to God, and what is not peculiar but may be given to a creature. And we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert againſt them, that all Divine worſhip and honor is peculiar to God, and none of it communicable to any meer creature. But he tells us of ſome Divine worſhip which is peculiar, and of ſome that is not
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:48559:87"/> peculiar. For the better underſtanding of this Truth, let it be looked into what Divine Worſhip is, and what the grounds thereof are.</p>
               <p>Divine Worſhip is that Obſervance in which we are carried directly and immediately to God, in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe things that directly bring honour to him, and glorifie him, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 21. <hi>When they knew God they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Cor. 8. 5. <hi>They firſt gave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up unto the Lord, and then to us, according to the will of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ground of this Worſhip or Obſervance, is, that excellencie of God, which in his ſufficiencie and efficiencie ſhines forth. It is not one attribute or perfection in God, that is the formal and adequate cauſe and reaſon of Divine Worſhip; but it is the concurrence of all infinite perfections and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 6, 7. <hi>The Lord, the Lord God mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful and gracious, long-ſuffering, and full of truth</hi> &amp;c. Therefore it is that ſometimes one at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute in God is ſaid to ingender homage and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130. 4. <hi>But there is forgiveneſs with thee, that thou mayſt be feared<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> And ſometimes another, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 28, 29. <hi>Let us have grace, whereby we may ſerve God with reverence and godly fear. For our God is a conſuming fire.</hi> And Divine worſhip is the acknowledgement of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Majeſtie, Truth, Wiſdom, Goodneſs, Glory of the bleſſed God.</p>
               <p>Divine Worſhip hath been wont to be divided
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:48559:88"/> into Natural worſhip, and Inſtituted worſhip.</p>
               <p>Natural worſhip flows from the very knowledge of God, if it be right and true, though there were no Law to impoſe any ſuch thing upon men; and it conſtſts in faith, and love, and fear, and hope, and thankfulneſs, and in praying unto God, and hearing what God the Lord will ſay to them: for of theſe, ſuch who have a right knowledge of God, will ſoon be convinced: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9. 10. <hi>They that know thy Name, will truſt in thee.</hi> And hereto alſo doth belong ſome natural external acts and poſtures of the body, which do hold forth the reverence and homage of the minde; as the bowing of the knees, and proſtrating of the body before God.</p>
               <p>Inſtituted worſhip is certain <hi>mediums</hi> or means, ordained by the will of God, for the putting forth and exerciſing of natural worſhip, <hi>viz.</hi> faith, love, hope, fear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are inward acts of the minde, and graces whereby we gratifie God, and honour him; and belong to Natural worſhip.</p>
               <p>This Inſtituted worſhip conſiſts in Ordinances and Services of God's own appointment, in which the Natural worſhip of faith, hope, fear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are acted, and by which they are promoved.</p>
               <p>Having ſhewed what Divine Worſhip is, and the grounds and kindes of it, it remains that I declare that all Divine Worſhip, (and not ſome alone, as he aſſerts) is peculiar to God, and not to be given to any creature, that is no more then a creature.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:48559:88"/> 1. That which is limited and reſtrained by Go to God alone, in the firſt and ſecond Commandment, and inhibited and forbidden to be given to any other, that muſt needs be peculiar to God alone. But all divine worſhip, both natural and inſtituted, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the poſtures that do attend them, as appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to divine worſhip, are limited and reſtrained by God to God onely, and prohibited to be given to any other: Therefore it muſt needs be proper and peculiar to God.</p>
               <p>For what elſe is the ſenſe of thoſe two Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods but me: Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelf any graven Image,</hi> &amp;c. but an injunction of the having and exerciſing ſuch divine Graces and Affections upon and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God above, and a ſubmitting to divine dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and inſtructions from God, in reference to the means of worſhip, and to him alone? All that hath been written and preached by the moſt approved, looks this way. They ſay naturall worſhip is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in the one, and ordained worſhip in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and he that gives the natural to any but the true God, ſets up and makes to himſelf another God beſide him; and he that ſets up, or ſubmits to any formes of worſhip, without the dictate or warrant of the true God, commits Idolatry againſt the true God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That which Chriſt doth appropriate to God, that muſt needs be peculiar to him.</p>
               <p>But Chriſt doth appropriate divine worſhip to
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:48559:89"/> God alone, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 10. <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him onely ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore divine worſhip is peculiar to God, and may not be given to any other.</p>
               <p>That which the Devil required of Chriſt, was proſtration, or bowing his body to the ground before him, in a Religious way; as for his heart, and the faith of it, and love or it, and fear of it, and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it, in any kind or the intention of thoſe affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he mentions them not, requires them not, nor could he know whether they were given to him, or no, nor in what degree and meaſure; but the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward homage onely, in the inclination of the body to the earth, in a religious way; and Chriſt yeelds not to it, but repels him with the Scripture, which he fetcheth from <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 13. or from Chap. 10. 20. or from Chap. 26. 10. for I find no other that Chriſt can allude to, and Expoſitors do direct to the two former; but in none of them is it ſaid. <hi>Him onely ſhalt thou ſerve;</hi> nor is it applyed to external ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: but our Saviour, an infallible expoſitor, doth extend it to religious poſtures, and outward homage in a ſpiritual way, and doth reſtrain it to God alone.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That which the Apoſtle condemned in the <hi>Galatians,</hi> while they were heathen, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be allowable in Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>But the doing of Religious ſervice, or giving religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or divine worſhip to them, which by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:48559:89"/> are not Gods, is the thing that the Apoſtle condemns in the <hi>Galatians,</hi> while they were Heathens, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 8.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is not allowable in Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>The Heathens when they worſhipped ſtocks and ſtones, and works of the hands of the Workman, they did it <hi>relativè,</hi> not <hi>terminative;</hi> that is, they worſhipped the higheſt being in theſe, and did not ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate and end their worſhip in theſe, but uſed theſe as helps in that worſhip which they directed to the moſt High God, whom they knew not, and carried their worſhip through theſe to him; as from <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 23. compared with 25. 29. will appear. They worſhipped Idols of ſilver and gold and graven ſtone, yet they knew that thoſe Idols made by mens hands were not God, but there was an unknown God, whom they worſhipped in ſuch Images: Yet this worſhip was accounted by the Apoſtle a doing ſervice to them which by nature are not Gods, and was condemned: And this intermediate ſervice which was not terminated in the thing ſerved, will not be allowed, as belonging to any other but to him, who is eſſentially God, and by nature God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That which neither the Angels, nor the moſt eminent Saints on earth, durſt accept, though tendred to them, becauſe they were but creatures, but direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to God as proper onely to him, that ought not to be given to any creature, but is peculiar to God. But divine Religious worſhip manifeſted in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward proſtration of the body, was a thing that the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:48559:90"/> Angels, and the moſt eminent Saints, durſt not accept of, becauſe they were but creatures; but directed it to God, as proper to him alone: Therefore divine Religious Worſhip ought not to be given to any meer creature, but is peculiar to God.</p>
               <p>There are many Scriptures which ſerve to confirm that which can in reaſon onely be queſtioned in this Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether all divine Religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, though intermediate, and in the loweſt degree, was rejected by Angels and Saints, as undue to them, and as proper to God: for this purpoſe, ſee <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 26. where may be found, that Adoration with the body, which did proceed from the eſtimation of the mind, though <hi>Cornelius</hi> that tendred it, knew <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> to whom he tendred it, neither to be God nor Chriſt; nor had he that eſteem of him, nor did he terminate that worſhip which he gave him, upon him; for he was better inſtructed; but through him looked at God: yet the thing was evil that he did, and undue to <hi>Peter,</hi> or to any meer man whatever, and was therefore rejected by <hi>Peter</hi> upon that ground and account; <hi>Stand up</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>for I my ſelf am alſo a man:</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, I am not God, but a man, a meer man, and nothing more; therefore it is not proper to adore me thus.</p>
               <p>So alſo in <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 10. and chap. 22. 9. <hi>John</hi> fell at the Angel to worſhip him, knowing him to be but an Angel, and looking upon him only as one through whom he had found favor to have ſuch things ſhewed him, and as one ſuperiour to him, becauſe an Angel,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:48559:90"/> as <hi>Rev.</hi> 32. 8. ſhews, <hi>I fell down at the feet of the Angel that had ſhewed me theſe things;</hi> it was upon this account that he fell down, He was an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, and had ſhewed ſuch things to him; he was not God, nor Chriſt, nor did <hi>John</hi> look upon him ſo: and it was but an outward proſtrating of his body before him, ariſing from that reverent eſteem that he had of him; yet it was not accepted by the Angel, but repelled and with this Argument repelled, <hi>I am thy fellow-ſervant,</hi> (as indeed the higheſt creatures are) <hi>and of thy Brethren, that have the teſtimony of Jeſus; ſee therefore thou do it not; worſhip God.</hi> Whence it is apparent, that the loweſt degree of Religious divine Worſhip, is too high for any creature.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That wherein Gods glory lies, and which he is ſo dear of that he will not give it to any other, and which when it hath been given to another, by his people, hath ſtirred up his jealouſie, that muſt needs be proper and peculiar to God, and is not to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to any other below God. But all divine religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worſhip is ſuch a thing wherein Gods glory lies, and of which God is ſo dear, that he will not give it to any other, but proves jealous preſently if it be given: Therefore all divine Religious worſhip is ſo proper and peculiar to God, that it is not to be given to another.</p>
               <p>The Scriptures that prove the Minor propoſition, which alone may be queſtioned, are <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 8. <hi>I am the Lord, that is my Name, and my glory will I</hi>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:48559:91"/> 
                  <hi>not give to another, nor my praiſe to a graven Image.</hi> This Glory which God will not give to any other, is ſuch worſhip which was wont to be given to a graven Image, and which the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> gave to the Calf in <hi>Horeb,</hi> which was intermediate worſhip, and was not terminated in the Calf, but in God; and yet God would not give that from him. And when God gives the ſecond Commandment, in which he forbids to be worſhipped through an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, (and by Image, any thing that may be thought of to repreſent him, is meant, as all confeſs that have been accounted Orthodox) he mentions his jealouſie which will ariſe in his beſt, if ſuch worſhip be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him; he will count it as if the Image, the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the repreſentative, whatever it be, were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, and not he; and he will viſit that ſin upon the Fathers unto their children to many Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>By this time I hope it will be evident unto the Reader, That all divine Religious worſhip is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to God alone. I ſhall now proceed to conſider of the reſidue of his Anſwer.</p>
               <p>He undertakes to ſhew difference betwixt the worſhip that is peculiar to God, and all other wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. His words are theſe:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That worſhip, honour, ſervice, which is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to God, differs from that which may be yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to a creature, partly in the matter, but wholly in the manner of it. We muſt pray to God for all things we want, and may pray to men for what</hi>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:48559:91"/> 
                  <hi>they can give; we muſt obey God, and we muſt obey men who are ſet over us by God: but we may not worſhip, honour, and ſerve men in the like manner as we do the moſt high God, who is the principal and ultimate object of all worſhip, honour and ſervice; his right thereto being onely of himſelf, and he himſelf being the ſole end thereof. According to this ſenſe, is that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand which our Saviour mentions.</hi> Mat. 4. 10. <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him onely ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> In theſe Lines, he hath multiplyed words, but hath not increaſed knowledge; he hath told us of a difference, but hath not ſhewed us what it is, he hath inſtanced in matter and manner, but not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared wherein, in what particulars, in either; he ſhewed reaſons of a difference, why it muſt be ſo; God is firſt and laſt, therefore none muſt be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped as he: but the difference is yet in the dark; I would intreat any one to fetch it out of his words, if he can. And if there be any light in his expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that light is darkneſs, yea blackneſs of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: he hath ſaid that God is the principal and ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate object of all worſhip, and ſo he leaves it, and therein he opens a dore to all Popiſh Idolatry; a man may worſhip a ſtock, or a ſtone, or any thing, provided that God be the firſt and the laſt, the principal and ultimate object in that worſhip that he gives thereto. What would any Papiſt deſire more at his hands? A graven Image may be an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:48559:92"/> of his worſhip, if it be not the principal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, nor the ultimate, but that he paſs through it to God.</p>
               <p>As for the difference in matter, he mentioned it, and then deſerted it, without giving the leaſt hint what it is. It had been needful that he ſhould have pitched upon ſome act or acts of worſhip of which it might have been ſaid. This act is ſo proper and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to God (materially conſidered) as that the like material act may not be performed to any that is not God: But he foreſaw that the giving of an inſtance herein, would have loſt the cauſe he pleads for: for though he might have given inſtances ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which might have held in reference to all other creatures, yet not any that would hold in reference to Chriſt, whom he makes but a creature; therefore he is ſilent. And though he gives inſtances of acts materially the ſame, which are performed to God and men; as praying, obeying; and ſaith the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is in the manner of performing theſe acts, yet he gives no ſatisfaction in reference to this diverſity of manner. And he mentions not the grounds of worſhip, and honour, and ſervice, wherein the root of the difference lies; for, the grounds are ſuch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which we worſhip God, that becauſe we meet not with them in any creature we have to do with, therefore we neither dare give the ſame worſhip for matter, or manner, that we give to God, to any creature.</p>
               <p>But as if he had given light enough, he concludes,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:48559:92"/> that <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 10. muſt be underſtood according to that ſenſe. What ſenſe means he? He would have God to be the principal and ultimate object in all worſhip; and that is enough, according to him; and being obſerved, Chriſt might have worſhipped the the devil, for any other caveat that he enters againſt it.</p>
               <p>I do not wrong him one whit; for his words are, That the command which Chriſt mentions in repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Satan that tempted him to worſhip him, <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him onely ſhalt thou ſerve,</hi> muſt be reſtrained to God, as he is the principal and ultimate object onely: and then if Chriſt had ſo underſtood it, as he doth, and reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to God his own place of worſhip, had made him his principal and ultimate object in worſhip, he might as the leſs principal and intermediate object, have worſhipped the devil, if he had pleaſed. And this Text which he alledgeth, of <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. (if there had been none other) would not have been of any force in this ſence againſt it. So that either Chriſt miſtook the Scripture, and alledged a Text that had not ſtrength againſt worſhipping of Satan, or elſe he hath groſly miſtaken the ſenſe of the Scripture which Chriſt hath alleadged, in giving liberty for intermediate worſhip to be given to him that is not God, notwithſtanding any thing contained in this Text.</p>
               <p>But becauſe he keeps to generals, and by that means reſolves no ſcruple that may lie in the breaſts
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:48559:93"/> of men about worſhip. I ſhall deſcend to ſome particulars.</p>
               <p>And firſt, I ſhall ſpeak of worſhip proper to God in the matter of it, wherein he is wholly ſilent; and then of worſhip proper in the manner of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To believe or receive any report of ſpiritual things and matters of Faith which reſpect the ſoul, propoſed and preſented as a truth to be reſted in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the meer credit and fidelity of the Teſtator, or him that witneſſeth it, is a worſhip and an honour proper to God alone, becauſe God is he alone that cannot lye, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 2. and it was the honour that <hi>Sarah</hi> by this Faith gave to God, ſhe judged him faithful that had promiſed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 11.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Religious reſting and depending for ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſupply and help in ſpiritual works and ſtreights, is a worſhip and honour peculiar to God alone: the reaſon is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe there is no ſufficiency of this kind in any creature, but it is onely and wholly in God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. Therefore the Prophet directs him that is in <hi>darkneſs, and hath no light,</hi> (it is ſpoken of the ſouls darkneſs and diſtreſs) to <hi>truſt in the Name of the Lord, and ſtay upon his God</hi> Iſa. 5. 10.</p>
               <p n="3">3. An acquieſcence in the will of another, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it appear to be with us, or whether it appear to be againſt us, is an homage and an honour which is proper and peculiar to God alone, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 18 <hi>It is the Lord</hi> (ſaid <hi>Eli) let him do what ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth good in his eyes:</hi> he ſubmits quickly, to that
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:48559:93"/> which was terrible to be thought of, upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count or ground, <hi>It is the Lord,</hi> to whom ſuch ſubjection is due. And Jeſus Chriſt himſelf as man doth acquieſce, and reſt ſatisfied with the will of God, which was bitter as death: <hi>Not my will, but thine be done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the obeying of the will of another, for this ſole reaſon, becauſe it is the will of that other, when there is no other impulſive cauſe but that, is honour peculiar and proper to God alone, becauſe his will, and his alone, is Eſſentially holy and juſt, and good. <hi>I conſulted not with fleſh and blood</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul)</hi> when the will of God was revealed that he ſhould teach him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 15, 16. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 2.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Praying, as it is an act of Religion, and then eſpecially, when it is for ſpiritual bleſſings, is a worſhip which is proper to God alone; becauſe ſuch a ſervice ſimply conſidered in its nature, doth imply a ſufficiency of wiſdom, power and goodneſs, in the perſon to whom we direct it: in reference to which, praying to any creature is accounted as praying to a god that cannot ſave; and it is Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in Scripture-reckoning, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 20. <hi>Jer.</hi> 1. 27.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Giving of praiſe, and glory, and thanks (as it is an act of Religion) is worſhip and honour due to God alone, and not to be communicated to any creature; becauſe he is the root and fountain of all good to the creature, the God of all Grace and mercy, the God of bleſſing. Therefore in <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 9, 10. 11, <hi>The four beaſts, and the four and</hi>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:48559:94"/> 
                  <hi>twenty Elders, they worſhip him that ſate upon the Throne by giving praiſe to him, and caſt down their Crowns at his feet, and ſay he is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to receive honour and glory, becauſe he had created all things.</hi> And as in the time of the old Teſtament, to offer Sacrifices of Thankſgiving to any but to the true God, had been Idolatry (which cauſed <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Barnabas</hi> to run in with haſt to ſtop them in the attempt of Sacrificing to them, by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them that they were but men like themſelves) ſo to offer the Calves of the Lips, to offer praiſe, to give Thanks, in a Religious way, is worſhip pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to God.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To Swear or to appeal Solemnly in a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous way for Teſtimony, in reference to any thing aſſerted, for the truth of it, is worſhip or honour that is proper to God, and not to be given to any creature, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 13. <hi>Thou ſhalt fear the Lord, and ſerve him, and ſwear by his Name.</hi> And it is reproved that ſome did <hi>ſwear by the Lord and by Malchom,</hi> that is, for joyning God and Idols to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in the worſhip of an Oath; and under that, all other worſhip is comprehended.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The uſe of a Lot, in which perſons that are at ſome controverſie, or are doubtful what to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of a thing, do give up themſelves to receive the determination of it, as the Lot being caſt ſhall decide it, it is a worſhip and an honour proper to God. <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 33, <hi>The Lot is caſt into the lap, but the whole diſpoſition thereof is from the</hi>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:48559:94"/> 
                  <hi>Lord.</hi> Therefore it was uſed with invocation, or prayer to God, wherein men do profeſs to receive the doome, or ſentence, or judgement, or deciſion from the Lord, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 24.</p>
               <p n="8">8. A receiving of, and ſubmitting unto, preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed forms and rules, as <hi>mediums,</hi> in and by which that natural worſhip of the heart, which conſiſts in faith, and hope, and love, is exerciſed and declared, is worſhip and honour proper and peculiar to God alone, and forbidden in reference to any creature, in the ſecond Commandment: for under the names of <hi>graven image,</hi> invented forms and <hi>mediums</hi> of worſhip, excogitated and minted in mens own brain, or of any others preſcribing, that is not God, are meant: and indeed, who knows what is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God, and delightſome to him, but himſelf? therefore the progative is his to preſcribe; and it is peculiar honour for men, to ſubmit to what he doth preſcribe. The ſubjecting of the Conſcience to Laws, and Ordinances, and Inſtitutions, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, is an honor not communicable to any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but wherein God is alone, not having any to ſhare with him; for the Conſcience is over-awed by none but God, gives account to none but God: <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15, the Apoſtle proves the love of God to be written in the excuſing and accuſing which work manifeſtly declares a Law of God within, becauſe the Conſcience is accountable to nothing but ſuch a Law: for there lies the ſtrength of his Argument, that there is ſuch a Law within them,</p>
               <p n="10">
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:48559:95"/> 10. In external poſtures, in Religious duties, the proſtration of the body towards the earth, and kneeling upon the knees towards the ground, is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and honour, and worſhip peculiar to God: <hi>O come let us fall down and kneel before the Lord our Maker,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95. 6. And its that which neither Angel nor men durſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, no nor admit of, but repelled it, and rejected it as undue, and directed it to God.</p>
               <p>Many more particulars there are, reſpecting the matter of worſhip, where God hath a peculiarity in point of right to worſhip and honour, above the creature: but ſome light is let in to ſuch (which might be groping in the dark) by theſe.</p>
               <p>I ſhall take in that light which Chriſt affords, (while I ſpeak of the manner of worſhip) and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie my ſelf with that. He ſums up all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments that reſpect God, in theſe words; <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God, and ſerve him with all thy ſoul, with all thy mind, with all thy ſtrength and might.</hi> So that that which is peculiar in the manner of worſhip, is the meaſure of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance ſuch a meaſure ought not to be given to any creature as to God: a perſon may be eaſily peccant in the exceſs in reference to the creature: if he give all to the creature, he gives too much; but leſs then all, is too little for God; the utmoſt created height is due to God, and peculiarly due to him, and to none other.</p>
               <p n="1">1. An abſolute Faith, and affiance, and truſt, is
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:48559:95"/> due to God alone, whatever the Subject-matter of it be, becauſe there is an abſolute and an indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſufficiency in God alone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to effect every thing; therefore it is that which the Lord pronounceth a bleſſed thing, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 7. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that truſteth in the Lord, and whoſe hope the Lord is:</hi> And the contrary the Lord pronounceth a curſed thing, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>Curſed be he that truſteth in man, and maketh fleſh his arm.</hi> A like place we have in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 146. 3, 5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An abſolute and unbounded love is due to God alone, becauſe he is infinite in goodneſs; and not to be given to any creature, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 15. <hi>Love not the world, nor the things of the world,</hi> &amp;c. Not the ſimple love, but the mordinateneſs of the love of the world, is forbidden; but God himſelf is to be loved with all the ſtrength of the heart, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 37.</p>
               <p n="3">3. An abſolute and unlimited fear is proper to God alone becauſe he is the Soveraign Lord, and to him it belongs to kill, or to keep alive; yea, he can kill and caſt into hell, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 51. They are firſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off from fearing the creature, and are afterwards put on to fear God.</p>
               <p>Much more might be added, if need did require: At preſent, let it ſatisfie the Reader, that I have thus far opened the difference in the matter and in the manner, betwixt the worſhip due to God, and that which may be given to the creature, which he left olded up in his Diſcourſe about it. I muſt now
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:48559:96"/> proceed to follow him in his Anſwer.</p>
               <p>He concludes his Anſwer to the Maior, with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration: his words are;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I wonder at the adjection</hi> (Meer) <hi>which you add to creature, as if a creature in eſſence could be more then a meer creature; or, as if ſome creature might have, as its right and due, that honour, worſhip, and ſervice which the Scripture doth appropriate to the moſt High God.</hi> And then he determines, <hi>Sure I am</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>creatures, as creatures, are excluded from ſharing with God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> I wonder that he ſhould make a wonder of that which himſelf is able to reſolve, according to the common Tenent which himſelf ſo lately held; and if he cannot, a child well bred, of 8 or 10 years old, can render a reaſon for it. Chriſt is a creature, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet not a meer creature: according to the fleſh, or as he is the ſon of <hi>Abraham,</hi> he is a creature; but according to the Spirit of Holineſs, or as he is the Son of God, he is not a creature: Chriſt is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, God-man, or God manifeſted in the fleſh; a creature, and yet created according to the divers natures that are in him. Conſider him in one of his natures, as born of the Virgin, as the ſon of <hi>Mary,</hi> ſo he is a creature in eſſence, and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect he is no more then a creature, and is excluded from ſharing with God in divine honour, worſhip, and ſervice; but conſider him in both his natures, conſider the whole of him, and then he is not a meer creature, but he is more then a creature; he is ſuch
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:48559:96"/> a creature, as that he is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the great Creator of all things, and ſo he ſhares with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in divine honour, but not as a creature, though he be a creature; for this perſon Chriſt, is both God and a Creature.</p>
               <p>After he had ſpoken to the Major, he comes to conſider of the Minor propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> That divine worſhip, and honour, and ſervice, is by Scripture-warrant given to Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>His Anſwer is, <hi>Sir, it is granted that Jeſus Chriſt is the intermediate object of divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, honour and ſervice, being Gods Vice-Roy, and acting among them in his Fathers Name, which the Scripture you bring confirms; But where the Scripture allows worſhip, honour, and ſervice to be given to him, as the principal and ultimate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject thereof, is not yet made to appear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. This diſtinction of intermediate object in reference to any meer creature, and principal and ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Object, is unſcriptural, he cannot bottom it upon any Text in reference to divine and Religious preſcribed worſhip.</p>
               <p>2. It is repugnant to Scripture-Teſtimony in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the whole of Chriſt whom the Father will have to be honoured, as himſelf is honoured, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 23. <hi>That all may honour the Son as they honour the Father:</hi> The Father will have no honour which the Son hath not; will have nothing in honour that is peculiar, that may be accounted proper to him:
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:48559:97"/> the Father will have no preeminence in worſhip above the Son; but look in what manner he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires men to honour him he requires them to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour his Son; and unleſs they do it, he accounts not himſelf honoured. If then the Father be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped as the principal &amp; ultimate object the Son muſt be worſhipped as the principal and ultimate object, elſe he is not honored as the Father is honored: The honouring of the Father is made the pattern and the example of honouring the Son. And if Chriſt ſhould be but a creature, if this be not Gods giving his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to another, when the like glory is given to him that is not God, as to him that is God; the like to the Son as, to the Father, and that according to the Fathers own deſigne and counſel; Let him that hath underſtanding judge: however, it overthrows his diſtinction.</p>
               <p>The place alſo that I alledged in <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 12, 13, 14. which he ſaith confirms his diſtinction, is fully againſt it; for all creatures in heaven, earth, under the earth, are repreſented by <hi>John</hi> in the ſervice of bleſſing, praiſing, honouring, glorifying the Father and the Son, in like manner, without any diſtinction: they are not heard worſhipping the Father through the Son, but worſhipping and honouring both Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Son, in like manner as two equals, or as two coeſſential perſons in the Godhead. Yea, leſt it ſhould be imagined, that he that ſitteth upon the Throne, is the principal object of the worſhip, and that the Lamb is the leſs principal, ſubordinate, and
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:48559:97"/> intermediate object of it, becauſe he is mentioned firſt, and the Lamb is mentioned after him; therefore <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. the four and twenty Elders are brought in, in this viſion, worſhipping him alone <hi>who liveth for ever and ever,</hi> without the mention of any other, though other perſons are not excluded. And who is this perſon that liveth for ever and ever? It is Chriſt, who gives himſelf this Title, though it be his Fathers Title alſo, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>I am he that liveth and was dead, and behold I live for ever and ever:</hi> So it is in the Greek, and it concurs in words with this Text of <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 14.</p>
               <p>3. This diſtinction, as he brings it and means it, opens a door to the worſhipping of men or Angels, any that may be called God's repreſentatives, and which act among men in Gods Name: for if that be the formal reaſon of worſhip given to Chriſt, <hi>He is Gods Vice-Roy or Repreſentative</hi> (which are not Scriptural Titles, but names of his own or others deviſing) <hi>and he is one that acts in Gods Name,</hi> then worſhip may be given to <hi>Moſes, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua,</hi> the Prophets; for <hi>Moſes</hi> was in Gods ſtead to <hi>Aaron</hi> and to the people: <hi>I have made thee a God to Aaron,</hi> ſairh the Lord to him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 16. And the Prophets came in Gods Name; may they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be worſhipped? According to his Argument they may; yea, any perſon or thing that is a means by whom or by which God diſpenſeth himſelf to men, in a Religious or ſpiritual way, or by whom or
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:48559:98"/> which we come to God in worſhip, may be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate object of Religious worſhip, and ſo we may worſhip our Miniſters which go to God for us, and from God come to us; and we may worſhip the Scriptures and the Ordinances, by which we have communion with God; for theſe are intermediate things betwixt God and us in worſhip, may they therefore be intermediate objects of worſhip? Seeing he makes Chriſt ſuch a god as other creatures are, (but more eminent then they) ſuch a god as <hi>Moſes</hi> was, as Magiſtrates and Judges were which carried Gods authority in the Offices upon them, a god of the ſame kinde with them; What reaſon can be rendered, if Chriſt be worſhipped upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, why they alſo (being ſuch-like gods as he, and coming with God's authority betwixt God and us) ſhould not be worſhipped as intermediate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, upon the ſame account? But this is very groſs, and makes his aſſertion concerning worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Chriſt as an intermediate object betwixt God and us, very groſs alſo.</p>
               <p>4. It is apparent that Chriſt both aſſumed, and Saints and Angels have given to him, that very worſhip, and honour, and ſervice which is peculiar to the high God alone, both for matter, and for manner.</p>

               <p>And if we have an eye to the manner of worſhip, we ſhall finde that Chriſt required it, and believers give it to him, in ſuch ſort as the moſt high God can onely challenge it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. An abſolute and univerſal truſt and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is put in Chriſt, ſuch as, that he, who is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to be the moſt high God, can challenge no more; and this both in the matters of the ſoul, in
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:48559:100"/> reference to which he is called <hi>the hope of Iſrael, Act.</hi> 28. 20. and the perſon <hi>in whom the Gentiles truſt,</hi> Rom. 15. 12. and alſo in matters of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon providence, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>I truſt in the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, to ſend Timotheus unto you ſhortly:</hi> that is, I truſt that Chriſt will ſo mercifully order it, that I ſhall ſend him, and that all impediments will be taken away. And if the providence of Chriſt doth extend to all things, and that the homage of depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance be given upon this account; what more can be ſaid of the moſt high God?</p>
               <p n="2">2. An abſolute and full love is both required and given to Chriſt; ſo that God, even the Father, can require no more: <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 37, <hi>He that loveth father, or mother, or ſon or daughter, more then me,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>is not worthy of me.</hi> But <hi>Luke</hi> expreſſeth it more fully, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 36. <hi>He that doth not hate father and mother, wife and children, brethren and ſiſters,</hi> yea <hi>and his own life, for Chriſts ſake,</hi> from that dear reſpect he bears to Chriſt, <hi>is not worthy of him.</hi> And Chriſt would draw <hi>Peter</hi> up to a love above his neceſſary food: <hi>Loveſt thou me</hi> (ſaid Chriſt) <hi>more then theſe?</hi> The meat that was before him was meant, the fiſhes that they were to feed on. And the Spouſe was ſick of love, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 8. And what greater proportion can the Father himſelf require, then what Chriſt asked, and what the Saints gave to him?</p>
               <p>The Inference then muſt needs be this: Chriſt is
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:48559:100"/> worſhipped, and honoured, and ſerved, with the worſhip, and honour, and ſervice, not of an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate object, but of the Principal and Ultimate object: and all ſuch texts which give the ſame wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to the Son as to the Father, do prove it. And if it were not ſo, men had need to look to their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance and affection to Chriſt, leſt it ſhould exceed; and that they neither put their whole truſt in Chriſt, nor ſet their whole hearts upon him, which would be due to him alone who is the high God, and the principal and ultimate object of theſe motions of the ſoul. So that this Doctrine of his doth call off the ſoul from being too much ſet upon Chriſt, as if it were poſſible to minde him too much, and affect him too dearly: which ſhould make all the true lovers of Chriſt to abhor it the more.</p>
               <p>Object.</p>
               <p>There is one knot yet to be untied, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I paſs off from this point of Worſhip. It may be ſaid, Chriſt is to be worſhipped as Mediator: the Scripture is clear and manifeſt for it; <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 10, <hi>At the Name of Jeſus every knee ſhall how:</hi> here is worſhip due to Chriſt, as exalted by the Father: Now he was exalted as he was Mediator, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to an Office that he had executed: and being Mediator, he is an intermediate object of worſhip: for a Mediator is one betwixt God and men, by which men come to God; and as ſuch an one, Chriſt is worſhipped.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> As Chriſt is Mediator, he hath a Lordſhip
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:48559:101"/> given to him; in which reſpect he ſaid to be made Lord, as he is made Mediator; and ſo there is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip belonging to him: But it muſt be thus under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, That as his Official, Oeconomical, and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atorly Lordſhip was founded in his Natural, Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Lordſhip, as he was the Son of God, and the moſt high God, coeſſential with the Father, as hath been proved before: ſo the Worſhip which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives as Mediator, as King, Prieſt, and Prophet of his Church, is founded not ſimply in or upon the Office, but upon the Excellencie of the perſon that manageth the Office; and if at all upon the Office, it is becauſe ſuch an Office cannot be executed but by ſuch a perſon who is the Son of God, and very God: For if it were poſſible to conceive how ſuch a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorly function could be performed by one that is not God, Divine religious worſhip would not be due unto him upon that account. It is the dignity of the Perſon that founds the Worſhip; and the Work doth but quicken to it; or becomes a motive the rather to perform ſuch homage and worſhip to him to whom it is due upon another account, upon another ground, if that Work had never been. Worſhip, and honour, and glory belonged to him, as the ſecond Perſon in the bleſſed Trinity, as the Eternal Son of God and God: and if over and above this glorious (and ever to be honoured and adored) perſon, become Mediator, it is the more readily and forwardly to be exhibited &amp; given. As every mercie
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:48559:101"/> received from the Father of mercie, becomes a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther engagement to worſhip and ſerve this Father of mercies; but the primitive ground is, This Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of mercies is God; otherwiſe, all mercie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſideration of the excellencie of the perſon from whom it proceeds, is not a right bottom to found worſhip upon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Mediator betwixt God and men, and a Type of this our glorious Mediator, Chriſt: but <hi>Moſes</hi> was but a Servant, not a Son; but a Creature, not God: and there was no religious worſhip nor honour that belonged to him, in reference to that work becauſe a meer creature performed it. And if it be otherwiſe in reference to Chriſt, that Chriſt as Mediator deſerves to be worſhipped; the reaſon is, becauſe ſuch a Mediatorſhip as Chriſt perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, could not have been performed, unleſs Chriſt had been God; becauſe, to execute that Function, requires the infinite power and wiſdom of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head: And therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> was the Type of that, which Chriſt really and effectually, and powerfully was: <hi>Moſes</hi> was <hi>internuncius,</hi> one that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and the people; but Chriſt made the atonement and the peace, being greater then <hi>Moſes;</hi> he being onely typically God, but Chriſt really and truely God.</p>
               <p>And though Chriſt be intermediate, being Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, yet he would not could not thence become an intermediate object of Worſhip, unleſs becauſe the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:48559:102"/> ſame perſon (though not according to both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) is alſo the principal and ultimate object of of it: which ſhews thus much, That this Worſhip which Chriſt the Mediator had, was due upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther account then his Mediatorſhip; otherwiſe it would have been limited and reſtrained, that that worſhip which is due to God, who is the ultimate object of worſhip, might have been diſcerned from it; and the preeminence the Father hath above Chriſt in Worſhip, would have been declared in Scripture.</p>
               <p>And hence it follows, that though Chriſt be an intermediate object of Worſhip, yet he is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal and ultimate object alſo: The ſame perſon who is Man and Mediator, is the Son of God, &amp; the moſt high God, &amp; Mediator in that nature alſo: And if Religious Divine worſhip be given unto him as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, it is given unto him for the ſake of the Divine Nature &amp; becauſe he is the Son of God, and God; according to which nature, apart conſidered from the Humane, he is the ultimate object of worſhip; but as conſidered with the Humane, as Mediator, he is the intermediate object of worſhip. And though the Humane Nature be taken up into the fellowſhip (as of the Godhead, ſo) of this honour and worſhip; yet this worſhip is not due, nor doth properly appertain to the Humane Nature: And though the perſon be honoured with this Divine honour, becauſe of the Union; yet it is for the ſake of the Divine Nature, and not for the ſake of the Humane, which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auſe
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:48559:102"/> it is not the principal and ultimate object of, worſhip; therefore that very worſhip, and no leſs, nor any other, is given to Chriſt, being thus interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate, or Mediator, which is proper and peculiar to God alone, who is the principal and ultimate object worſhip, cannot (ſeparately and apart conſidered from the Divine Nature) be any object at all, no not an intermediate object of Religious Divine worſhip: for then every creature that is a <hi>medium,</hi> or a means, by or through which God communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates himſelf to men, and ſo is intermediate betwixt God and man, ſhould be an intermediate object of Divine worſhip; which is directly repugnant to the Scripture, and is greatly derogatory to God. that the Manhood of Chriſt, or the Humane Nature, a part conſidered, hath but the reſpect of an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in ſo glorious a work, which was wrought by the efficiencie and infinite power &amp; wiſdom of God.</p>
               <p>I have been the larger in diſcuſſing this point of Worſhip, becauſe the right underſtanding of it will facilitate the diſcuſſing of the two next which follow, which reſpect Faith in Chriſt. He conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them together; though I conceive they may well be diſtinguiſhed from each other, as different things. But I ſhall follow him in his method.</p>

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:48559:103"/> And the verſe that immediately precedes, <hi>viz.</hi> verſe 13. declares thus much: It is ſaid that <hi>the Son of man is in heaven;</hi> which at that time when Chriſt ſpake thoſe words, was impoſſible, as Chriſt is the Son of man, becauſe Ubiquity, or being everywhere at the ſame time, is not compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible to any man, as man: but it was meant of the Perſon of Chriſt, who is called <hi>the Son of man,</hi> becauſe he was truely man; but according to the other nature that was in him, <hi>viz.</hi> the Godhead, according to which he was in heaven and on earth together, becauſe he fills both, as God.

He puts another ſence upon it, ſaying, <hi>He that beleeves one, beleeves both, becauſe God appears merciful in the face of Chriſt, and Chriſt appears inſtrumental in the hand of God,</hi> Rom. 4. 24. and 10. 9. And ſo he makes Chriſt an inſtrument (who could not (as he ſaith) raiſe himſelf from the dead) the object of faith, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our Reſurrection and Salvation, which is groſs; for Chriſt is the object of our faith, as he is able to ſave, not himſelf onely, but us, to the utmoſt. And
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:48559:105"/> though Chriſt be the Son conſidered as ſent, and as having taken fleſh, and as Mediator, and ſo is the object of faith; yet he is the ſame perſon as before he took Fleſh, and was Mediator, though under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſideration; yet the taking of Fleſh hath not made him another perſon, much leſs another being; and ſtill he remains the ſame God with his Father.</p>
               <p>And though as he is conſidered in Fleſh, and as Mediator, he be an intermediate object of faith, yet he is alſo the principal and ultimate object of faith, as he is the Eternal Son, and ſecond perſon in the Trinity; for the ſame perſon may be both the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate and the ultimate object of Faith, under a divers conſideration: this was one part of his emptying of himſelf; the Son became Mediator in Fleſh, and ſo the intermediate object of faith, who yet was, with the Father, the ultimate Object of it.</p>
               <p>And Chriſt, though he had been Mediator, yet if he had not been God, he could not have been the intermediate Object of Faith, no more then <hi>Moſes</hi> was, who was Mediator; he was not the Object of Faith, nor could be, becauſe he was but a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>Moſes</hi> was one by whom they beleeved on God, and ſo were the Prophets, and alſo the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelf and of <hi>Apollo,</hi> that they were Miniſters by whom the <hi>Corinthians</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Mediums</hi> or means by whom
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:48559:105"/> they were brought to faith in Chriſt and God; but Objects they were not, no not intermediate objects of their Faith; ſo Chriſt could have been but a means of faith in God, if he had been no more but a man, and had not been God.</p>
               <p>The brazen Serpent, which was a Type of Chriſt, to which the promiſe was made, That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever looked up to it, ſhould be healed, (and it was really ſo; they were healed, as God in the promiſe ſaid, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. 8, 9.) was onely a means by which they beleeved in God, being but a creature, and not an intermediate Object of Faith; they did not beleeve on it at all, but through it, on God; and ſo it muſt have been ſaid of Chriſt, had he been but a meer creature, had he been but onely the man Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And though it cannot be denyed, but that whole Chriſt, as conſiſting of two natures, being God and man, is Mediator, and materially conſidered is the intermediate Object of Faith; yet not the whole of Chriſt is the formal cauſe of faith in Chriſt, but the Divinity or Godhead of Chriſt alone, is the formal cauſe, and reaſon, and ground of the faith of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in Chriſt; for that is the Rock upon which the ſouls of Saints are built, and a firm, unſhaken, unmoveable Rock it is, and the gates of hell ſhall never prevail againſt Beleevers, whoſe faith doth bottom them upon this Rock.</p>
               <p>But he ſaith, <hi>It is from Gods commandment,</hi>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:48559:106"/> 
                  <hi>that faith in Chriſt is needful,</hi> Joh. 3. 23. <hi>And it is from Gods appointment, that faith in Chriſt is ſaving,</hi> Joh. 6. 40.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> All faith that juſtifies and ſaves, as well that which hath God, <hi>viz.</hi> the Father for its Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as that which hath Chriſt for its Object, is by Gods commandment and appointment juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and ſaving: for the firſt Covenant was of Works; which men brake, and were under death by breaking it; and then came both the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of faith, and the promiſe of life, that was made to faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>The Scripture foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that God would juſtifie the heathen through faith,</hi> &amp;c. God freely made choyce of faith, to ſave men by it, as well of that which reſpects him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as that which reſpects Chriſt. I hope he will confeſs that it was by inſtitution that faith in him that ſent Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the Father, is needful and is ſaving.</p>
               <p>But if his meaning be, that no faith was due to Chriſt naturally, ſave what is due by vertue of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment and commandment; It is utterly untrue, if extendeded to whole Chriſt; for Chriſt is the natural Eſſential Son of God; and look what faith was due to the Father, the ſame faith is due to Chriſt, as the Eternall Co-effential Son of God.</p>
               <p>Or if this ſenſe be given to the words, that there was nothing but a Commandment, that could move
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:48559:106"/> or draw to faith in Chriſt, that is falſe alſo; for <hi>Nathanael</hi> was drawn to beleeve without any commandment, that came to him to that purpoſe, from thoſe beams of his Deity, which ſparkled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him in thoſe words of his. <hi>Before Philip cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thee, when thou waſt under the Fig-tree, I ſaw thee;</hi> And many others believed on him when they ſaw his Miracles; So that not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment onely, but his own Almightineſs and Infinite Excellency, brought credit and gained faith to him.</p>
               <p>The concluſion is this: Though it ſhould be granted, that Faith in the Father and faith in Chriſt do act in a divers manner (as indeed it muſt, Chriſt being conſidered as Mediator) yet it will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that either in one manner or another Faith doth act upon a creature, but that ſtill the perſon is God that it acteth upon.</p>
               <p>And it is to be obſerved, that he hath not inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidated that Scripture in <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 1. but it ſtands in full force ſtill; for though he would have i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Inſtance</hi> 4. If Chriſt be but a meer creature, then a meer creature is the Saviour of men, ſaving them with a mighty and eternal ſalvation, as the Scripture ſpeaks: but this is againſt the whole cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of the Goſpel, which ſpeaks of God our Saviour, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 10, 13.

               <p>In anſwer to this, he ſaith,</p>

                  <hi>Againſt this your inſtance, I ſhall level this aſſertion, which will be ſufficient to diſcover its weakneſs, and confute it; That to affirm Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt to be the Saviour of men, without God, or equal with God, is contrary to the current of the whole Scripture, which doth diſtinguiſh God from Chriſt in the work of Salvation, calling him a Saviour as diſtinct from Chriſt,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 1. <hi>where God is ſaid to be our Saviour, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to be our hope, and in the Text you alledge, and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where frequently.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> To level one aſſertion againſt another, is to level Arguments by way of oppoſition, not to
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:48559:107"/> anſwer Arguments by way of ſatisfaction: Yea, it is to evade anſwering by objecting. And it is a ſlie and crafty way of anſwering, when there is a knot which is difficult, and perhaps impoſſible to be untyed, in any Scripture or Argument, to paſs it over with ſilence, and onely propoſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what which may trouble and perplex the truth in it, or the mind rather of him that reads it. Thus he did in his Anſwer to the two laſt Inſtances, and now again he runs to theſe fig-leaves to cover the nakedneſs of his Tenent from that ſhame which this Argument or Inſtance, enforced with ſo uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable a Scripture, would caſt upon it. But I ſhall inforce the Scripture alleadged by me, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it will carry conviction along with it to the hearts of ſuch who ſhall duely perpend and conſider it; and afterwards ſhew the weakneſs of his aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>In this Scripture of <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 10, 11, 13. the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks of Chriſt all along: in <hi>v.</hi> 10. he calls the doctrine of the Goſpel, the Doctrine of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour God. So it is in the Original, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>That they may adorn the Goſpel of our Saviour God:</hi> in <hi>v.</hi> 11. he ſpeaks of the ſame God Chriſt: for by the grace of God, he means the Goſpel of grace, or the Doctrine of Grace, which he had in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer verſe called the Doctrine of our Saviour God. This Doctrine or Goſpel hath appeared unto all
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:48559:108"/> men: in <hi>ver.</hi> 13, he ſtiles Chriſt the bleſſed hope, which is elſewhere made the title of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 13. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 21. And he puts the denomination of the great God and our Saviour upon Chriſt. It is not <hi>a great God,</hi> without an article, as he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged to evade the ſtrength of <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 1. But it is <hi>the great God,</hi> with an Article. This Text I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented among the Scriptures which I produced, and it was the third in order; but he paſſed over it then, promiſing to ſpeak to it when he ſhould give in his anſwer to another Paper; and here he takes no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it neither: What may be the reaſon? but becauſe he is not able to preſent any thing which can clould and darken the bright evidence of it; for it witneſſeth two things with great clearneſs, 1. That Chriſt is God, great God, the great God, or that one great God. 2. That Chriſt, though he be man as well as God, yet he is Saviour chiefly and eſpecially as he is God, and not as he is man; For, conſidered as God, he is able to ſave to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt. As he is man, there are actions done by him, and ſufferings born, by which men are ſaved; but the vertue, force, efficacie, and valour of both the one and other, are as he is God.</p>
               <p>And he ſaveth with the Father as the principal efficient, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 21. <hi>I am a juſt God and a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and there is none beſide me.</hi> This is the perſon that took fleſh, that thus ſpeaks. It is cleer from <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 10, 11, that it is Chriſt; but the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:48559:108"/> Father is not excluded; and the meaning is, there is none other God that ſaves, but what Chriſt is: Becauſe the Father, and Chriſt, and the Spirit, are one principal efficient that ſaves.</p>
               <p>It is further confirmed, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>I will ſave them by Jehovah their God:</hi> it is the ſpeech of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah the Father, concerning Jehovah the Son, whom he calls their God; and promiſeth them to ſave by him. And it muſt not be underſtood that this ſalvation is inſtrumentally effected, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>I will ſave them by,</hi> &amp;c. For, the titles given to the perſon by whom the Father will ſave, do ſhew that he is not an inſtrument. Is Jehovah their God but an inſtrument in ſaving? Is one Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah inſtrumental to another? or is it onely the order of working betwixt the Father and the Son? Are there two Jehovahs, and both of them our God? <hi>Moſes</hi> tells Iſrael, <hi>Jehovah our God is our Jehovah;</hi> for Eſſence one, though two in perſons, <hi>Deut.</hi> 60. 4. The order then betwixt the perſons is onely to be obſerved and acknowledged, not any ſuperiority or inferiority in working.</p>
               <p>But let me conſider his aſſertion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To affirm Jeſus Chriſt to be the Saviour of men without God, or equal with God, is contrary to the current of Scripture.</hi> Thus he.</p>
               <p>But againſt what expreſſions of mine is this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:48559:109"/> levelled? I have affirmed that whoever ſaves, muſt be God; therefore Chriſt, becauſe he ſaves, muſt be God. But where have I ſaid that Chriſt ſaves without God? To ſave as God, and to ſave without God, are theſe two one thing? Or are they not rather repugnant and contrary to one another? But ſuppoſe (as it muſt needs be) that by God he means the Father, I have not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted that Chriſt ſaves without the Father, by way of efficiency, but the Father ſaves by the Son, Chriſt Jeſus, and the Son ſaves from the Father: But I aſſert them to be equals in ſaving, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this order betwixt them: for it is but one God that ſaves, though in diverſity of perſons; and this one God cannot be ſuperiour and inferiour to himſelf. And all the confirmation that he himſelf gives of his own Poſition, is this, That God in Scripture is diſtinguiſhed from Chriſt, in the work of Salvation; and he quotes, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 1. where God is ſaid to be our Saviour, and the Lord Jeſus is onely ſaid to be our hope: But this hath no ſtrength in it; for in <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 4. God hath not the title of Saviour given unto him, when he is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Chriſt, but hath the relative title of Father onely given him; but Chriſt is called Saviour, and is diſtinguiſhed from God by that name. Is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, <hi>viz.</hi> the Father, leſs a Saviour, or an unequal Saviour to Chriſt, becauſe Chriſt, and not he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is called a Saviour? And is not Chriſt called
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:48559:109"/> both the bleſſed hope, and the great God our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our? Are not both titles put upon him, as due to him? And though they are uſed by the Apoſtle to diſtinguiſh the perſons of Father and Son from each other when they are ſpoken of together, yet both theſe are applyed to both perſons, and are proper to him alone, that is the moſt high God.</p>
               <p>But he ſaith,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scripture doth prefer God in the work of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation before our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, making him to be the principal Agent therein, when it declares that the work of Chriſt in ſaving, was from the purpoſe of God, who appointed him for it; from the precept of God, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned him to it; and from the preſence of God, who aſſiſted him in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> But where doth Scripture witneſs this of God the Father, in reference to the whole of Chriſt? He ſaith, Scripture doth abundantly ſet forth all theſe; but he doth not quote any one place for proof of them, but would have us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it upon his word. That God purpoſed to ſave by Chriſt, conſidered as <hi>David</hi>'s and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>'s ſon, conſidered according to his Manhood; that God enjoyned him as ſuch, that God aſſiſted him as ſuch (God being taken eſſentially and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, for Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt; and not
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:48559:110"/> improperly and perſonally, for the Father) will be granted; and it will be plentifully made out by Scripture: but that the Father purpoſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Son and holy Ghoſt, and commanded and enjoyned without the Son and holy Ghoſt, and aſſiſted without the Son and holy Ghoſt; this is denied. For as the Father without the Son and holy Ghoſt made not man, but the Trinity ſate in Councel; <hi>Let us make man:</hi> ſo it was in the work of Salvation; it was an act of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel: The Father gave the Son, and the Son gave himſelf, emptied himſelf: every Perſon concurred and wrought in the work, ſo far as concerns effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie: All decreed it, all acted in it, as one principal Agent; and onely the Humanity of Chriſt was Inſtrumental.</p>
               <p>And if we conſider the Material and Merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cauſe of mens ſalvation, God the Father, or God in the perſon of the Father, is far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Principal cauſe thereof; for he is no cauſe at all: for the Father took not fleſh upon him, nor was Mediator either of Satisfaction or Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion; he made not the Atonement; but this was the Son's ſole work, he did all in it; he was the perſon that was <hi>made of a Virgin,</hi> and was <hi>made under the Law;</hi> he was the perſon that <hi>was made fleſh,</hi> and <hi>manifeſted in fleſh;</hi> and hath a peculiar right, in this reſpect, to the denomination of <hi>Saviour.</hi> And though all was
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:48559:110"/> acted and endured in and by the fleſh that he aſſumed: for he bare our ſins on his body on the tree; yea, and in his ſoul alſo, when he cried out, <hi>My God, my God,</hi> &amp;c. in ſuch manner; yet if that fleſh had not been ſupported by the Godhead of the Son, which aſſumed it, it would have been crumbled to duſt and powder by that weight of wrath that lay upon it: So that it was by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and power of the Godhead, that ſuch actings and ſuch ſufferings were; and all was accounted as done and ſuffered by the Son, though the Son, as the Son, was not capable of it, but by aſſuming fleſh into the unity of his perſon; and ſo it came to be reckoned as his work; and it was in account as if <hi>the Lord of glory</hi> had been crucified, and as if <hi>the blood of God</hi> had been ſpilt, and the merit was from the excellencie of the perſon of the Son, that did and ſuffered all.</p>
               <p>But he further ſaith,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Scripture revealeth the Lord Chriſt to be in the work of ſalvation but an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Saviour. For this,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſee</hi> Tit. 3. 4, 5, 6. <hi>which puts it paſt all queſtion. But after that the kindneſs and love of God and our Saviour towards man appeared, not by works of righteouſneſs which we have done, but according to his mercy, he ſaved us by the waſhing of regeneration, and renewing of</hi>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:48559:111"/>

               </p>
               <p>Here is in theſe words of his,</p>
               <p>Firſt, A bold aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> That Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealeth Chriſt to be but an inſtrumental Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A peremptory Concluſion, that <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 4, 5, 6. puts it out of queſtion.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A defective and inſufficient probation, or confirmation; he alledgeth the words of the Text as if they did carry with them conviction of what he aſſerts in the very letter of them, when as there is no ſuch matter.</p>
               <p>1. Scripture is ſo far from revealing ſuch a thing of Chriſts inſtrumentalneſs, that it reveals the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it: in <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. it is ſaid, <hi>That Chriſt by himſelf purged away our ſins;</hi> but of any inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments can it be ſaid that by himſelf he doth any thing? Doth an inſtrument act by himſelf, that is, by his own vertue and ſufficiency? and by himſelf, that is, without the power of the principal efficient? Is an Inſtrument any thing out of the hand of the chief Agent? Alſo in <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. it is ſaid, <hi>That Chriſt is able to ſave to the utmoſt;</hi> But is any Inſtrument able to ſave to the utmoſt? Hath he the ability within himſelf? So that it may be ſaid of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:48559:111"/> him, that he is able? What greater thing can be predicated of the principal efficient, or chief A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, then that he is able to ſave to the utmoſt? This is too high an expreſſion for an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 19, it is ſaid of Chriſt (whom <hi>David</hi> typified) that God had <hi>laid help upon one that was mighty.</hi> If Chriſt be onely but an Inſtrument, what needs he to be mighty in himſelf? for every Inſtrument if it be mighty through the might of another (as the <hi>Rams horns</hi> were) it is ſufficient. What need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the choice of a mighty one, if the Saviour be onely inſtrumental? The weaker the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the more honour will the Principal Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient have. The excellencie of Power is known to be of God, when the inſtrumental means is Weakneſs and Fooliſhneſs. Why alſo could not the blood of Goats have cleanſed the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but the Blood of JESUS CHRIST, God's Son, was neceſſary, if an Inſtrument may be a Saviour? Doubtleſs, a word of Inſtitution would have made the one as effectual as the other.</p>
               <p>But indeed, there is no might that any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Inſtrument is capable to be recipient or the ſubject of, that can ſave to the utmoſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it requires an infinite power to conquer Sin and Satan, Death and Hell; to aboliſh theſe, and to bring Life and Immortality to light;
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:48559:112"/> to effect a firſt and ſecond Reſurrection for men who were to be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Scripture that he alleadgeth out of <hi>Titus</hi> 3. 3, 4, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, hath no ſuch thing engraven upon it, as he produceth it for; ſuch that <hi>he that runs may read</hi> it written there, or he that reads may underſtand without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioning, that whole Chriſt is but an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>For all that is aſſerted by the Apoſtle, is, that God the Father our Saviour, ſaved through Chriſt our Saviour, by the holy Ghoſt. And what doth this hold out, but the Order among the Perſons in their working? And when JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOVAH ſaves by JEHOVAH their God, doth this particle <hi>[by]</hi> import inſtrumentalneſs? I have ſhewed the contrary.</p>
               <p>Indeed, the Manhood of Chriſt is made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental to the Godhead of Chriſt, and to the whole Trinity, in this great deſigne of the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt, to ſave men; but it cannot in this place be applied to the Manhood, becauſe the Spirit is ſhed or given from the Father, through Chriſt, not as Man, but as God, as I have ſhewed in the other Treatiſe.</p>

                  <hi>Inſtance</hi> 5. The 5. Inſtance he forms up into an Argument, thus, <hi>That Doctrine which makes the Mediator betwixt God and man, to be a meer crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, brings in (as it were) another Goſpel, deſtroyes the true Goſpel in many of the parts of it,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in that it is againſt reaſon, that the Mediator ſhould be a creature, becauſe a meer creature is no way meet to be a Dayſman for God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; becauſe a Mediator muſt either partake of both God and man, or of neither, elſe he will be rather a party, then a Mediator,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and in that it oppoſeth theſe Scriptures,</hi> Mat. 1. 23. 1. Tim. 3. 16. Joh. 1. 14. <hi>But that Doctrine which denies Jeſus Christ to be the moſt high God, makes the Mediator betwixt God and man to be a meer creature.</hi> Therefore I ſhall paſſe by all thoſe lines in which he only trifles, &amp; ſpeaks not to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumnet or inſtance, and mention only that which is materiall, in way of anſwer.</p>
               <p>To the Major, and the firſt reaſon of it, <hi>viz. A meer creature is no way meet to be a Dayſman for God,</hi> He anſwers thus;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This reaſon wants a reaſon to ſupport it, what ſhould hinder (ſaith he) but the meere creature may be a Dayſman or Mediator? Is there any one work that belongs to his office, that is impoſſible for a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to perform, notwithſtanding divine aſſiſtance with him? I dare, ſaith he, aſſert the contrary, and am able to prove in whatſoever work you can inſtance in, belonging to Christs Mediatorſhip, that of himſelf he was not able to perform it, unleſſe by</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> There are many things that may hinder, that a meere creature cannot be a Dayſman, or Mediator for God: 1. The diſproportion that is betwixt God and a meere creature hinders, which diſproportion is infinite. It is againſt Gods honor and glory, that God ſhould admit of a meer ceature-Dayſman or Mediator: It is as if a worm ſhould be a Dayſman or Mediator for a man; or as if a begger ſhould be a Dayſman or Mediator for a King. Nay there is not any thing to reſemble it by among all the creatures; and there would be too much honour put upon a meer creature, if he ſhould be Mediator or Dayſman, becauſe a meer creature is infinitely below God; but a Dayſman ſhould hold ſome kind of equality with the perſon for whom he is a Dayſman: For 1. The matter is committed to him that is a Dayſman or Mediator. 2. The perſon that commits the matter to the Dayſman, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits himſelf with it to him alſo. 3. A Dayſman is one that muſt judge betwixt: now this is too low for God to admit of, and too high for man, or for any meer creature, that it ſhould be ſet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n ſuch a place. 2. The impotency and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iy of the creature hinders that it cannot be a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>meet Dayſman for God: For 1. No meer creature can attain unto a perfect knowledge of the treſpaſſe and offence that is committed
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:48559:113"/> againſt God, becauſe it is infinite, therefore no finite creature can ſearch into it, the perſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom it is committed being infinite, makes it infinite; and one of a finite knowledge cannot reach it: it may be truly ſaid, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man nor Angel, nor the Son of man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as man, knowes the greatneſſe of mans ſin: for unleſſe the greatneſſe of God can be meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, againſt whom it was committed, the greatneſſe of the ſin cannot be known. Now if it cannot be known by any meer creature, then no meere creature can be a Dayſman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of it. 2. No meer creature can be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſenſible of the great diſhonour that was offered unto God, and the great indignity and injury that was done againſt God, when man ſinned again him; for what is all creature-ſenſe, to that infinite perception which God hath of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ffront done unto him; and unleſſe you could make the creature as God, a creature cannot have the feeling of God; and unleſſe a creature had the infinite holineſſe of God, a creature cannot know how diſtaſtfull ſin is unto God; therefore a meer creature cannot be a Mediator or Dayſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man for God; for he cannot ſenſibly enough conſider of the tranſgreſſion againſt God. 3. No meer creature can make Propoſalls that are proportionable, in reference to Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that was impaired by the ſin of man, that God might be no loſer, nor might receive any
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:48559:114"/> detriment by Mediation; becauſe no creature knowes how much the honor of God is impair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and if he did, yet it would be beyond his power to offer honorable terms to God in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence thereto, for a creature will act and move like a creature, and all its Propoſalls will be low and little, and defective and ſhort, yea infinitely low &amp; ſhort, and like it ſelf, therfore a meer crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot be a meet Dayſman for God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he will be ſure to wrong him. 4. The Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator betwixt God and man, is not of interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on onely, but of ſatisfaction; now no meer creature can give ſatisfaction for mens offences, becauſe offences are greater then can be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of, &amp; the ſatisfaction muſt be like them, that is, muſt be greater then can be imagined by any creature, therefore greater then can be given by any creature. The Mediator is an undertaker to ſatisfie for what is paſt by paying the utmoſt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and to render man a new creature, incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and devoted to God, who was before an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie. Now no meer creature can be ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaker, becauſe he cannot give a price ſufficient nor work any ſuch transformation in man, but it belongs to him who made heaven and earth to do this.</p>
               <p>Theſe things are impediments why a meer creature cannot be a Dayſman betwixt God and men, there are things to be known and done which creatures, as creatures, are not capable of.
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:48559:114"/> His daring therefore to aſſert the contrary, ſhews rather his preſumption then his wiſdome or ability.</p>
               <p>And whereas he ſaith, <hi>that he is able to prove that Christ of himſelf was not able to perform any work belonging to his Mediatorſhip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unleſſe by the aſſistance of another, which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, and ſo was a compleat Mediator.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is utterly untrue and repugnant to the Scripture, for by himſelf he purged away our ſins, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. and herein he debaſeth Chriſt not a little, he makes him as weak as one of us, and he concurres with thoſe enemies of Chriſt in their reproaches which they caſt upon him when he was upon the Croſſe, he brings in the ſame verdict with them, yea, he hath meaner thoughts in ſome kind, then they, <hi>he ſaved others</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>but himſelf he cannot ſave,</hi> that is, by his own power, he cannot, for otherwiſe they knew God could ſave him; the Apoſtle had not ſo high thoughts of him, but he hath as low thoughts, I am able, ſaid the Apoſtle, to do all things through Chriſt ſtrengthening me, but he faith, Chriſt himſelf is able to do nothing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Fathers ſtrengthening of him. If this be true which he aſſerts, that Chriſt is able to pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form norhing of himſelf without aſſiſtance of another: God might then have ſaved by <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>James</hi> or <hi>John,</hi> or any man elſe, whom
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:48559:115"/> he would have looked upon in reference to that work, as by Chriſt. Is ſuch a Mediator as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciphers Chriſt to be (ſo poore, ſo empty as he makes him to be, not able to do any thing in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of that office he is deſigned to of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf without aſſiſtance) a meet object of the faith, and hope of the Saints?</p>
               <p>If he had aſſerted this of the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſt, that it was able to do nothing by way of ſatisfaction in the function of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorſhip of it ſelf, without the aſſiſtance of the Divinity, or Godhead of Chriſt, it had been an undeniable truth, but to aſſert this of whole Chriſt, in whom the ſullneſſe of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head dwelt bodily, or ſubſtantially, and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, and in whom are hid all the treaſures, all the mines of wiſdome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and knowledge, and all excellency, and in whom are all unſearchable riches, this is ſuch a vilifying of him, that it is a ſecond crucifying of him, and it is not his boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of being able to prove it that makes the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill the leſſe, but it is the more horrid by how much he is confident, This Doctrine muſt needs weaken faith, &amp; hope, and affiance in Chriſt, and indeed if it were ſo (as he ſaith) that we had ſuch a Mediator, ſo impotent and ſo weak, of all creatures we were moſt miſerable.</p>
               <p>But he proceeds, and attempts to break the ſtrength of the ſecond reaſon which I produced to prove, that a meer creature-Chriſt could not
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:48559:115"/> be Mediator betwixt God and men, which was this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Becauſe a Mediator muſt either partake of both God and man, or of neither, elſe he will rather be a party then a Mediator.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this he anſwers thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Was not Moſes a Mediator betwixt God and men, but was Moſes God and man?</hi> Gal. 3. 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep. Moſes</hi> was a typicall Mediator, and was that myſtically, and figuratively, which Chriſt was really and truly: <hi>Moſes</hi> was not God and man, but man onely eſſentially and ſubſtantial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet he was as God to <hi>Aaron,</hi> and to the people, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 16. God reputatively he was, and repreſentatively; and this was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for him that was not that true Mediator, but the ſhadow of him: but he that was ſhadowed out, and is no ſhadow, but Mediator indeed and in truth, he muſt be God indeed, and in truth: And this Argument of his fetched from <hi>Moſes,</hi> is ſtrong againſt him, it is like that of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> produced to prove the eternity of Chriſt, upon which I have inſiſted more largely, the ſinews of which no humane ſtrength can cut aſunder.</p>
               <p>But he ſaith, <hi>When I brought this reaſon, I knew not what I did, for it gives witneſſe againſt me.</hi> And he argues againſt me by the help of the reaſon which I have produced. I ſaid, <hi>if Christ were not God as well as man, he would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:48559:116"/> be a party then a Mediator,</hi> and he thence diſputes againſt me thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If Chriſt the Mediator were God he was a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but Chriſt the Mediator was not a party, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt the Mediator was not God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> The Major Propoſition how clear ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it is to him, is notſtithſtanding, unſound, and untrue in it ſelf, for there is a twofold Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, there is <hi>Mediator participationis,</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator negationis;</hi> a Mediator of participation, and a Mediator of negation, that is, a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, that partakes of both, and a Mediator that partakes of neither. If there be a breach betwixt the father and the mother, and a child comes betwixt and mediates, the child ſtands re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated alike to both of them, and partakes equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of both of them, and is a Mediator of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation: If there be a breach betwixt two neighbours, and a third neighbour comes in and Mediates, he ſtands in relation to neither of them, nor partakes of either of them, he is a Mediator of negation, neither the one nor the other is any thing to him; neither of theſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators are parties: the latter is not by his own confeſſion, and it is as clear that the former is not, for he is not properly a party that partakes of both, but he that partakes not of both, or at leaſt, not of both alike, but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of the one, and not of the other, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes more of the one, then of the other; for
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:48559:116"/> diſparity of relation in the Mediator to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons betwixt whom he mediates, makes the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator a party, and not parity and equality. If there ſhould be a difference betwixt two bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and a third brother come in betwixt them to mediate and make peace, he is not a party, or if he be, he is a party to both, and a party to both, is in proper manner of ſpeaking a party to neither; but if there be a controverſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two half brothers, and another comes in to mediate who is a whole brother to one of them, he is rather a party then a Mediator, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſtands not in ſo near a relation to the one, as to the other.</p>
               <p>The application is eaſie, Chriſt is a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor betwixt God and man, not of negation but of participation, for a man he is (without all controverſie betwixt him and me) and in all things like to us, ſinne onely excepted, and if he be a man, then he partakes of man; and partaking of man, he calls men his brethren, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 11, and if he ſhould not partake of God equally, as he doth of man, and ſtand in like relation to God, as he doth to man, he would be a party rather than a Mediator, but being God as well as man, he is no party, but a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, or a middle perſon in a proper accepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not negatively, but relatively, ſtanding in equality of relation without any diſparity; and in this ſenſe, it would be true, (as he ſaith) that
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:48559:117"/> if Chriſt were God, he would be a party, if he were not man alſo as well as God, for then then there would be a diſparity, and inequality of relation in Chriſt the Mediator, in reference to the one of the perſons betwixt whom he me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diates; he would be more nearly allyed to the one, then to the other, more to God then to man: but as he frames the Argument, if Chriſt the Mediator be God, then he is a party, when as it is manifeſt that he is man alſo, &amp; no nearer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to God, though he be God, then he is to man becauſe he is man: the Major is palpably falſe, &amp; muſt be denied: by that time he hath ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſidered of this, which I have here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, I hope he will be forced to confeſſe, that I knew<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what I did when I brought that reaſon, that Chriſt, if a meer creature, would be a party rather then a Mediator. But he gives an inſtance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In reconciliation</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>by a Mediator, we are to ſuppoſe three: One offended, another offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a third mediating for peace betwixt them. God was offended, men were offenders, and Chriſt was the Mediator. Now if Chriſt had been a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man, he had been of the party offending; and and if he had been God, he was the party offended; but Christ was not a Party: From the Propoſition which I have thus confirmed, and the Aſſumption which you have acknowledged, I will draw up this Concluſion, That Chriſt the Mediator is not God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> In this Inſtance, and in the application
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:48559:117"/> of it, there are ſome things that are juſtly liable to exception, and other things manifeſtly falſe: 1. That there be three in reconciliation wil be granted, but that the third muſt be ſo diſtinct as he holds it forth, as not to partake of the other two, is denied: For, a ſon that mediates betwixt father and mother (which may ſomtimes be the caſe) is of the fleſh of both, and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is diſtinct from both but not ſo diſtinct as not to partake of both. So in the reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made by Chriſt betwixt God and man, there are three that are diſtinct: 1. There is God offended: 2. There is man, <hi>viz.</hi> mankind, offending: 3. There is Chriſt mediating, who is neither meerly and only God, nor yet meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and only man; but is both God and man, yet diſtinct from both God and man: Diſtinct from God becauſe he is man, and diſtinct from man, becauſe he is God. Yea there is yet a further di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction; for, Chriſt though he be man, <hi>viz.</hi> of that kind, for nature and eſſence, which was the offending party, yet not one of thoſe perſons in that kind, that did offend, but without ſin him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and though he be God, and ſo for eſſence and nature one with that party which was offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and was offended in his own perſon, yet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct in perſonality, or (which is all one) a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct perſon from the Father and the Holy Ghoſt, who more viſibly do manage the offence againſt man. For the Son, though he was offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:48559:118"/> together with the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt, yet he appears not proſecuting the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, but therein he is veiled, and appears only appeaſing the Father that was offended: in both theſe reſpects there are three in this buſineſſe of reconliation.</p>
               <p>But he makes mention of three in reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which in titles and names are the ſame with the three which I have already ſpoken of; <hi>viz.</hi> God, men, &amp; Chriſt: But when he comes to open and unfold theſe three, he makes the third, which mediates betwixt the other two, to be ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from both of them, as to partake of nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them: And under this lies couched the poyſon and malignancy of his doctrine; For, as he layes it down, he not only denies the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of Chriſt (which is the doctrine in diſpute betwixt us) but he deſtroyes the Manhood alſo, and overturnes that ſatisfaction, which in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man he gave for man; for his words are theſe, <hi>If Chriſt had been a ſinfull man, he had been of the party offending:</hi> His deſigne is to ſhew, that he was a diſtinct perſon, &amp; partaked of neither Party betwixt whom he mediated; <hi>He was not of the Party offending, for he was not a ſinfull man; He was not the Party offended for he could not be God, becauſe he could not be a Party:</hi> Let it be conſidered ſeriouſly what he ſaith, and it will be found to be falſe and dangerous, and reacheth not his own deſigne.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:48559:118"/> 1. Falſe, for was Chriſt therefore not of that Party, becauſe he was without ſin? Was he not a true man in all things like other men, ſin onely excepted? Had he not a true Body and Soule? Was not ſoule and body ſubject to the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities and weakneſſes (ſin excepted) as other mens ſoules and bodies were? Was he not the Seed of the Woman which was promiſed? Was he not conceived in the womb of the Virgin, and was fleſh of her fleſh? Was he not <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> ſeed, and <hi>Davids</hi> ſeed? Was not Satan to be broken and deſtroyed in all his ſtrength by one that muſt be of the Woman, that muſt ſpring out of her, and be her ſeed? And ſhould all this be, and yet Chriſt not this Party? He was no offender indeed, but yet he was of that Party which did offend, he had the ſame nature for eſſence: <hi>Abraham</hi> was of that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which offended, and ſo was <hi>David,</hi> and were offenders themſelves, and he was their ſeed, and was of them and from them; therefore it is a great untruth and groſſe miſtake to ſay that he was not of that Party; for he was fleſh of their fleſh, and bone of their bone, but kept by the Holy Ghoſt from that naturall pollution and ſtaine which defiled them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Dangerous; for if Chriſt were not of that party that offended, he could not ſatisfie for that party which offended; for in the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in which the offence was committed, muſt
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:48559:119"/> the ſatisfaction be given; for both the juſtice and truth of God required this. It was threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that the ſoule, that is the perſon that ſins, ſhall die, and if another ſuffer that penalty, yet it muſt be one in that nature; therefore it is ſaid, he bore our ſins on his own body on the tree: It was neceſſary it ſhould be ſo, els the truth of God would not be fulfilled, nor juſtice ſatisfied. And if Chriſt be not of the off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nding party, if he be another from them, not parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of them, but be of another nature, and not of theirs, then he might as well have been no man at all, for any fruit or bene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>it that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crues to ſinfull man thereby: And Chriſt might as well have taken the nature of Angells, and as much to the benefit of loſt men, as have aſſumed fleſh, if it be not th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. It reacheth not his own deſigne, which is to make Chriſt a third and diſtinct perſon or party, from thoſe he mediates betwixt, parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of neither; for he knowes, that if it be confeſſed, that Chriſt partakes of the nature of one of the parties whom he is to make peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt, and not of the other, then he will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably be a party inſtead of a Mediator: to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void therefore this, he holds that he partakes of neither; and yet he makes Chriſt a man not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, but not a man of the offending
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:48559:119"/> party. But this diſtinction will not help him, for if he be a man, for ſubſtance and eſſence like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>them, he is nearer related to them as ſuch, then he is to God, if he be not God; and then he will be a party ſtill, rather then a Mediator. For a party is one that partakes more of the one then of the other.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Suppoſe that to be (which he diſputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt) as a thing very abſurd, <hi>viz.</hi> that Chriſt were of the party offended, and were alſo of the party offending, as in truth and deed Chriſt is, though not in the ſenſe that he underſtands it, yet the conſequence is naught, that he muſt therefore be a party; for a party to both makes him a pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the next place he conſiders of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which I produced, to prove the Mediator to be more then a meer creature, <hi>viz.</hi> the high God: and firſt,</p>
               <p>I made uſe of the title that is given to Chriſt, <hi>He is called Immanuel, which is God with us, or God in our nature, Mat.</hi> 1. 23. His Anſwer is;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Immanuel was not the name of Chriſt, but a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of his name Jeſus, which (ſaith he) is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest if we compare the</hi> 21, 22, <hi>and</hi> 23. <hi>verſes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Now the name Jeſus ſignifies not the nature,</hi>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:48559:120"/> 
                  <hi>but the office of Chriſt, as the Angell expounds ver.</hi> 21. <hi>thou ſhalt call his name Jeſus, for he ſhall ſave his people from their ſins; and ſo Immanuel notes out that certain aid that God would affoord by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt to his Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep. Immanuel and Jeſus</hi> are not one and the ſame name, nor have they one and the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation? nor doth the name <hi>Immanuel</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> nor doth <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 21. 22, 23. ſhew any ſuch thing: all that can be collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is this, 1. That both the names do belong to Chriſt, he that is <hi>Immanuel</hi> is alſo <hi>Jeſus.</hi> 2. That theſe two names do ſo neceſſarily imply one the other, that they cannot be ſeparated, therefore the Prophet (ſpeaking of his birth) ſaith, <hi>his name ſhall be called Immanuel,</hi> and the Angel, ſpeaking of his birth, ſaith, <hi>his name ſhall be called Jeſus,</hi> alluding therein to the Prophet, becauſe Chriſt is firſt <hi>Immanuel,</hi> and afterward <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and he was <hi>Immanuel,</hi> that he might be <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and he could not be <hi>Jeſus,</hi> unleſſe he were <hi>Immanuel;</hi> this is the cauſe, and that is the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and he that denies him to be <hi>Immanuel,</hi> denies him to be <hi>Jeſus:</hi> therefore the Angel ſtiles him by the name, that is, the effect, and then ſends us to conſider of the name, which is the cauſe, which the Prophet gives him.</p>
               <p>Now whereas he ſaith, the name <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſignifies not the nature, but the office of Chriſt, as the Angel expounds it, <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. This ſhews, that
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:48559:120"/> the name <hi>Immanuel</hi> is not the ſignification of the name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> for <hi>Immanuel</hi> doth import not office, but nature, or natures in Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the divine and humane nature united into one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which other Scriptures make manifeſt, which I have already quoted, in <hi>John</hi> 1. 14. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. and others may be added, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 6. 7. <hi>he being in the form of God emptied himſelf and came in the form of a ſervant, and</hi> Heb. 2. 16. <hi>he took not the nature of Angells, but the ſeed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and Col.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>In him dwelleth all the fullneſſe of the Godhead bodily,</hi> ſuch Scriptures as theſe ſerve to interpret the name <hi>Immanuel,</hi> &amp; do declare that it doth denotate two natures in Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the divine and humane. For if it ſhould onely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port divine help, &amp; aid reached out unto us, then every believer might carry that name as well as Chriſt, becauſe God doth reach out grace and favour, and aſſiſtance to each Saint: But without doubt becauſe there was a breach betwixt God and us through ſin, &amp; we were driven from God, and God became a ſtranger to us, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 31. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord would give a ſing, as it is expreſſed in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7. 14. in Chriſt whom he would ſend, of a reunition and conjunction betwixt himſelf and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ain in Chriſt, that we may not be faithleſſe but believe, we ſhall know that he will dwell with us; For he ſhall viſibly dwell in Chriſt to our conviction. So that there are two reaſons
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:48559:121"/> why Chriſt is called <hi>Jmmanuel.</hi> 1. Becauſe he is both God and man in one perſon. 2. Becauſe he is the bond of that conjunction, that is to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and us; but withall it doth import that reconciliation which he effects as Mediator betwixt God and us, giving himſelf a ranſome that our ſins might be remitted, and we might be accepted again into favour; and if this be the certain aid that he ſpeaks of, which comes by Chriſt to the Church, he is ſo far right, but yet reacheth not the root of the matter; for this aid is from the mightineſſe of his perſon. If God had not united with our nature, our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could never have united with God: but God came down to us, and in the perſon of Chriſt gave evidence to us that he was God with us.</p>
               <p>The next Scripture which he undertakes to anſwer, is 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>without controverſie great is the mystery of godlineſſe, God was manifeſt in the fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His anſwer is, <hi>Ancient Interpreters (ſaith a learned man) as the Latine, the Syriack, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabick,</hi> Ambroſe <hi>and</hi> Auguſtine <hi>make this read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be ſuſpected, for they read not as we do, for thus they read the words, And without controverſie great is the myſtery of godlineſſe, which myſterie was manifeſted in the fleſh.</hi>

                  </gap> be put in inſtead of it, and ſo the words run thus, Great is the myſtery of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which is manifeſt, is the fleſh, why doth he not improve this reading to his own purpoſe, and interpret what is meant by the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery which is manifeſt in the fleſh, and make the reſt of the words to concurre with it, that he may gain credit to ſuch a reading? Alas he knows very well the following words will not <hi>quadra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> they will not correſpond nor ſuit with ſuch a reading.</p>
               <p>By the word <hi>myſtery</hi> there are (who follow this reading) that underſtand the Goſpell, which is called a <hi>mystery,</hi> but was the Goſpell mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in the fleſh, &amp;c. and received up into glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? certainly it muſt be meant of ſome perſon, that was in fleſh, and was received up to glory; therefore if it be the myſtery that was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:48559:122"/> in the fleſh, and received up into glory, it was not the Goſpell, for the Goſpell is the glad tydings of good things in Chriſt; and was the glad tydings of good things in Chriſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in the fleſh, and were glad tydings received up into glory? it is abſurd to be aſſerted.</p>
               <p>If he underſtand any thing elſe by Myſtery, which was manifeſted in the fleſh then the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, it muſt be the ſoul of Chriſt, which he ſaith was created before the reſt of the creatures, and which in time took fleſh, and was manifeſted in the fleſh; but was it ſo great a Myſtery for the ſoul to come into the body after the body is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the womb? is it not that which is done every hour in the formation of man? doth not the ſoul unite with the body in the generation of all that are born in the world.</p>
               <p>And indeed though he grant our reading, yet he brings all to this, for his words are,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is not denied but that Chriſt was a God, and the Text ſaith but this, a God was manifeſted in the fleſh, that is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>appeared viſible amongſt men, when he took unto him a body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> If Chriſt was a God before he took fleſh, then he was ever a God from the firſt that he was, and that was (by his own conceſſion) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was any creature created, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently before any actuall Soveraignty was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon him; for that could not be before the world had an actuall exiſtence, over
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:48559:122"/> which he was to have his actuall Soveraignty, and then it will follow that he was God by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from all eternity with the Father and the Holy Ghoſt, but this I have diſcuſſed before; that which I ſhall add is this, look what a God Chriſt was, ſuch a God he was in fleſh, but Jehovah he was, the mighty God he was, the great God he was, the true God he was, the everlaſting God he was, God over all bleſſed for ever he was, ſubſiſting in the form or nature of God he was, and equall with God, ſuch a God he was as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly teſtified in Scripture, therefore ſuch a God he was manifeſted in fleſh.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Hincmarus</hi> his conceipt, that this word <hi>God</hi> was put into the Text by the Neſtorians, I have him not by me, and I much heed it not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the very Text it ſelf gives witneſſe to it ſelf, that the word is not added by mans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice or fraud, for if it be left out, the reſt of the words are made nonſenſe thereby.</p>
               <p>The third and laſt Scripture that I made uſe of to prove Chriſt as Mediator, not to be a meer creature, and nothing elſe, was this.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid in Joh. 1. 14. <hi>The Word was made Fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Anſwer is, <hi>The creature that was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly made by God, took unto it a body. I find no place</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>where the fleſh of Chriſt ſignifies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing more then his body, according to which he</hi>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:48559:123"/> 
                  <hi>died, and is no where taken for the humane nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> This conceipt of a creature immediatly made by God, which took unto it a body, hath been at large ſpoken to, and confuted in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Treatiſe: It hath alſo been the word, that the word Fleſh is taken Synechdochically for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, a part being put for the whole. I find no cauſe to add any thing either to the one or other, but ſhall conſider of the Reaſons which he leaves me to pauſe upon, by which he would prove Chriſt the Mediator to be a meer crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Let me oppoſe (ſaith he) your Propoſition with two or three Reaſons.</p>
               <p>Rea. 1. <hi>Becauſe whole Chriſt is a creature, if ſo, then either a meer creature is Mediator, or Chriſt is not a Mediator.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> The greater part of my former Treatiſe is ſpent in the confuting of this aſſertion, I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think it needleſſe to ſpend more time or ſtrength about it, eſpecially ſeeing he refe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>res to what he ſaid before, and brings no new ſtrength to it.</p>
               <p>Rea. 2. <hi>Becauſe a Mediator is not of one,</hi> Gal. 3. 20. <hi>Now if Chriſt be God, then he is a Mediator of one; for he cannot be a Mediator to himſelf, and there is but one God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> It is true (as the Apoſtle ſaith) that a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator is not of one, that is, not of one Party, for
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:48559:123"/> a Mediators work is to make peace; now it is to be alwaies ſuppoſed, that no one is at variance with himſelf, therefore a Mediator is not of one, but of two Parties that diſſent the one from the other, which Parties are God and Man.</p>
               <p>But his deduction which he fetcheth from this ſaying is faulty, which is this, If Chriſt be God, then is he a Mediator of one, for he cannot be a Mediator to himſelf, and God is but one: if this were a ſound conſequence, Chriſt would be Mediator to none at all, and the reaſon is this, There are but two Parties diſagreeing, God and man: Now all the Elect in all the world they are reckoned in this account but as one man; Now if Chriſt be man, took their ſeed, then he is of this Party, then he is Mediator to himſelf, and the words may be retorted, A Mediator is not of one; but if Chriſt be man, then he is a Mediator of one, for he cannot be Mediator to himſelf, for all men are but as one, come under one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and he is among them; if he be a man being of their nature, and true man of their ſeed.</p>
               <p>Therefore there muſt be a diſtinction made concerning Chriſt; Chriſt may be conſidered <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, either in his nature &amp; perſon, as he is the ſecond in the Trinity, and the eſſentiall Son of God, or in reference to his Office, as he is God in fleſh, and King, Prieſt, and Prophet to
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:48559:124"/> the Church, and appointed Dayſman; and if this latter acception, he is not Mediator to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, though he be God, for he is God-man, and ſo differs from himſelf, conſidered <hi>nudè,</hi> as God, or the ſecond perſon in the Divine Trinity; that which was aſſerted before concerning this man alſo conſidered.</p>
               <p>Rea. 3. His third reaſon is the ſame for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with the ſecond, <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Chriſt is a Mediator betwixt God and man,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 5. <hi>Now if he were God, he could not be a Mediator betwixt God and men, for he could not be a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator to himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This hath been conſidered in the former rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, only there is thus much new in it which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves conſideration: <hi>Timothy</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>calls the Mediator betwixt God and man, the man Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let the whole text in that place of <hi>Tim.</hi> be conſidered and duely weighed, together with the Apoſtles ſcope and deſign, and with the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of a learned man upon it, and it will prove Chriſt to be both God and man, and Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator betwixt God and man, for the words in the Greek run thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: which may be thus rendred, For the man Chriſt Jeſus is one God, and one Mediator betwixt God and man. There may be theſe reaſons for ſuch a verſion or
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:48559:124"/> tranſlation of the words; 1. Becauſe the ſubject perſon that is ſpoken of is but one, and that is the man Jeſus Chriſt, and of him it is predicated and aſſerted, that he is one God, and one Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator betwixt God and man, all is ſpoken of him; for if there were two divers ſubjects ſpoken of, <hi>viz.</hi> God the Father, and the Mediator Jeſus Chriſt, as is generally conceived, and muſt be granted according to the ordinary tranſlation of the words, then the Articles would not have been omitted, as thoſe that underſtand the Greek Tongue underſtand very well. If God had been the ſubject ſpoken of, and if it had been aſſerted or predicated that he had been one, the words would have been, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; and if the word Mediator had been the ſubject, and that it had been predicated and aſſerted of him, that he had been one, the words wold then have been <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, both of them would have been with the Article <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but this Article is not prefix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to either of them, therefore neither of them are the ſubject ſpoken of, but rather they are things that are ſpoken of an other, which other is the man Jeſus Chriſt, he is one God, and one Mediator betwixt God and man; and if it be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then I have held forth, it is quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the manner of the Greeks, and there will be hardly any place to be found that will pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallell this, where there is ſuch an Omiſſion.</p>
               <pb n="250" facs="tcp:48559:125"/>
               <p> Now, if it ſhould be objected that there is no Article prefixed before the man Chriſt Jeſus, which yet I ſay is the ſubject of whom theſe things are ſpoken, I anſwer that there needs not any Article there, becauſe of the proper names Jeſus Chriſt, before which the Article is uſually pretermitted.</p>
               <p>If we alſo conſider the ſcope of the Apoſtle, it is more congruous thereto, the words being tranſlated as I have preſented; for his degſin is to prove, that now the Church of God was not to be kept within the narrow bounds &amp; limits of Judea as heretofore, but to conſiſt both of Jews and Gentiles, as the verſe before ſhews, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other, <hi>God wil have all to be ſaved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth:</hi> But how doth the Apoſtle prove that? by this fifth ver. he proves it, for, ſaith he, the man Jeſus Chriſt is one God, and one Mediator betwixt God and men, if the words did run as they are tranſlated, <hi>For there is one God, and one Mediator betwixt God and man;</hi> there would be no ſuch good conſequence, for there was ever one God, and ever one Mediator betwixt God and men, and yet the Church did not extend beyond the bounds of Judea; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle ſpeaks of God under a new conſideration, which was not before, till the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles times, and that is of the man Jeſus Chriſt, who is God bleſſed for ever more, and
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:48559:125"/> whoſe work is to unite both Jews and Gentiles into one, as in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 28. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 11, And when he calls this man Jeſus Chriſt one God, it muſt be taken of <hi>Deus uniens,</hi> God making one in a practicall way, as in <hi>Zach.</hi> 14. 9. The Lord ſhall be King in all the earth, and in that day the Lord ſhall be one, and his Name one. This Lord is Chriſts, for of his Kingdome is this ſpoken, which ſhall be ſet up in all the earth, and in that day <hi>(viz.</hi> the day of his regnancy over all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, both Jews and Gentiles, for it is a prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of ſuch a time) the Lord ſhall be one, and his Name one; it is not meant of the oneneſſe of eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, for the Lord was alwaies one in that ſenſe, but of operation <hi>effectivè,</hi> he ſhall be one, he ſhall work alike, and in one manner in all Nations, and ſhall make them all one in him, they ſhall all ſerve him with one ſhoulder, with one conſent. So in this of <hi>Timothy,</hi> God would have all to be ſaved, and to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth; for Jeſus Chriſt is one God and one Mediator, that is, God uniting all in one, and reconciling all in one; The man Chriſt is God, and Mediator effecting this. This was foretold long before, but God is come in fleſh now to accompliſh it.</p>
               <p>But if this expoſition ſhould not paſſe, it is eaſie to give another, for it is not denied, but that Chriſt Jeſus was and is a man, nor is it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:48559:126"/> but that as Mediator he was a man, and it will be further confeſſed, that he could not have been Mediator unleſſe he had been man; for therefore it was that he took not the nature of Angells, but the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he might be a meet Mediator to reconcile us to God. But the point in diſpute is, Whether as Mediator he was not more then a man, or then a meer crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and I have already ſhewed, that to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate for God, and to God, required more ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency and ability then can be found in man or any creature.</p>
               <p>The next Inſtance or Argument that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced was this.</p>

               <p>Now what is it that he anſwers to this? He produceth a text out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 22. by the menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of which he would divert the eyes of the Reader from the conſideration of <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 9. (which was the Text that I produced for the confirmation of my Inſtance, or Argument) and would carry them to the conſideration of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Text which ſpeaks a truth, concerning which there is no controverſie betwixt him and me: He tells me of a righteouſneſſe of God by the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt, and of Gods being the principall Author of this righteouſneſſe, which I grant, though not in his ſenſe, for he means it of the Father alone, but I underſtand it of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Spirit, this God is the efficient <hi>à quo,</hi> the efficient from whom righteouſneſſe is, for it is he that doth account perſons that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve righteous, and doth acquit them from ſin for the ſake of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33. 34. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 32.</p>
               <p>But what is this to the purpoſe? is this any An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to my Argument, or to the Scripture I produced? I ſpake of a righteouſneſſe imputed
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:48559:127"/> to believers, which is the materiall cauſe of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers juſtification, or of his righteouſneſſe in the ſight of God; and the imputation of this righteouſneſſe is the formall cauſe of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and this righteouſneſſe that is imputed, is called the righteouſneſſe of God, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 9. but he tells me of a righteouſneſſe of God, which is from God as the Author or principall Efficient, which is only true in this ſenſe, as God is he that appointed, decreed and inſtituted the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt for the Juſtification of Beleevers, and doth alſo pronounce them juſt upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. But the Apoſtle <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 9. doth not call the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt the righteouſneſſe of God in that ſenſe, the words are theſe, <hi>That I may be found in him, not having on mine own righteouſneſſe, which is of the Law, but that which is through Faith of Christ, the righteouſneſſe which is of God through Faith.</hi> The Apoſtle in this place ſpeaks of a righteouſneſſe which is by the Faith of Chriſt materially, as it is oppoſite to that righteouſneſſe which he calls his own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe; and the one, <hi>viz.</hi> his own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, he calls the righteouſneſſe which is <hi>ex Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge,</hi> of the Law: now this muſt be underſtood materially, not efficiently; God did account per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons juſt while the Covenant of works was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot, in reference to righteouſneſſe, which mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:48559:127"/> did conſiſt in our obedience of the Law, the obedience of the Law was the matter of it, therefore it is called the righteouſneſſe which is of the Law.

The Apoſtle ſpeaks not here of an Act of Grace in God, that imputes the righteouſneſſe of an other unto Beleevers, as theirs, and ſo accepts of it, but he ſpeaks of that which is imputed, and is become a covering in which he would be found; and this he calls the righteouſneſſe, not of the Law, but of God, <hi>viz.</hi> the obedience of that perſon who is God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt.</p>

God himſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, this God made Chriſt (conſidered as Mediator and ſurety of the Elect) a ſinner, that is, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted him ſo: here is the Efficient <hi>à quo,</hi> from whom this was, this was God. 2. Here is the materiall cauſe, which is our ſins put on him, and made his, for he had none of his own, it was for us. 3. Here is alſo the formall cauſe, which is in the imputation of our ſins to him; it was for us that he was made, that is, by laying of our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities upon him inſtead of us, <hi>Iſay</hi> 53. 6. 4. Here is the finall cauſe that we might be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him, in which there is, 1. The efficient cauſe, that we might be made (that is) by God, accounted, reckoned by God. 2. There is the materiall cauſe, which is the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of God, <hi>viz.</hi> of Chriſt, who is called in this place God, which is put on us, for we have no righteouſneſſe of our own, as Chriſt had no ſinnes of his own. 3. There is the formall cauſe, which is Imputation; we are made, that is, by this righteouſneſs of God put on us; therefore it is ſaid, <hi>through him;</hi> that is, through the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:48559:128"/> of this righteouſneſſe of his, which is called the righteouſneſſe of God, or els through him, may be through faith in him.</p>
               <p>He alſo makes Chriſt from this text of <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 22. to be but an inſtrumentall A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, in this righteouſneſſe of a believer; I ſuppoſe he draws it from theſe words [by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt] for he will have this particle <hi>[by]</hi> to refer to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentalneſſe of the thing to which it doth belong: And if it were granted him in this, it would but make faith inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, and not Chriſt; for it refers to faith, and not to Chriſt; It is not ſaid, <hi>By Ieſus Christ,</hi> but <hi>by the faith of Ieſus Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and Chriſt is mentioned as the object of this faith, which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of as the inſtrument. There is the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, which is called the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, which God looks upon, and hath reſpect to, and for the ſake of which God accounts perſons juſt and righteous: and this righteouſneſſe is therefore reputed the meritorious cauſe of our juſtification; and faith layes hold of this, and is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to convey it to us, and to make it ours: So that this text ſerves not his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:48559:129"/> nor doth it at all help him in that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of his, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Christs instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talneſse in agencie</hi> in reference to this righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe. In the meane time he hath wholly paſſed over in ſilence the text that I alledged to prove my Argument by, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeaking one word in anſwer, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the manner in which he hath dealt with me formerly.</p>
               <p>But he undertakes to ſhew what that is in Chriſt which is imputed to us for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>his obedience which was both active and paſſive: The opinion now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is that the active obedience of Chriſt, whereby he did perfectly fulfill the Law, and his paſſive obedience, whereby he did perfectly ſuffer the curſe of the Law, are imputed to us for righteouſneſſe. Now he could not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>obey the Law as he was God, nor could he ſuffer the curſe of the Law but as he was man; and ſo that righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse of Chriſt which was imputed to us was a creature-righteouſneſse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> It is granted that it is the obedience
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:48559:129"/> of Chriſt, both active and paſſive, that is imputed to us for righteouſneſſe: But why he expreſſeth himſelf in ſuch language <hi>[the opinion now-adayes is ſuch]</hi> as if it were but an opinion, and not the truth of God; as if it were others opinion, not his own opinion: as if it were now-adayes the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, not the opinion of former times; and as if onely he made uſe of it againſt me, and to promote his own aſſertion of a meer creature-righteouſneſſe imputed to us, and not that he did believe it (for ſo may any one judge that reads his expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) I cannot conceive why he ſhould ſpeak thus if he be ſound in that point.</p>
               <p>What ever his meaning may be in ſuch words, yet ſure I am his inference which he makes therefrom (notwithſtanding the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon wherewith he ſeemeth to inforce it) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s not right. <hi>He could not obey the Law as God, he could not ſuffer the curſe of the Law but as he was man, therefore his obedience which is imputed for righteouſneſse, was as he was a creature.</hi> There is a <hi>non ſequitur</hi> in it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f it be put into the form of an Argument it will appear. If Chriſt could neither obey nor ſuffer but as a creature, then the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Chriſt which is imputed for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:48559:130"/> is the obedience of a meer crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for in that ſenſe he takes it: but the former is true, therefore the later. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence in the major Propoſition is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound, the reaſon is, becauſe though obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be imputed for righteouſneſſe, yet not ſimply and meerly becauſe it was obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and anſwered the Law, but becauſe it was the obedience of ſuch a perſon who was ſo great and glorious, as that he was not leſſe then God, but very God, yet as God he performed it not, but as he was man; but the Godhead inabled the Manhood thereto, and did put the value, and worth, and rate, and price, upon that ſervice of the Manhood.</p>
               <p>Nor do I underſtand how Chriſt (if he had been a meer creature) could have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed a righteouſneſſe that could have been reckoned to another, in as much as it would have been all due, wholely due to God, as from himſelf being a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, becauſe of that abſolute Soveraignty in God over every creature; Nor doe I know how a meer creature-obedience can be imputed for righteouſneſſe to many millions of creatures, when yet any one of thoſe creatures to whom it is imputed
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:48559:130"/> muſt have done as much, and muſt have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered as much in reference to his own tranſgreſſion, as that doing and ſuffering of Chriſt which is imputed to him amounts to, if Chriſt be but a meer creature.</p>
               <p>And whereas he ſaith, <hi>He could not have obeyed the Law as he was God;</hi> I ſay, he could not (being but one) have obeyed the Law for ſo many, if he had not been God. He alſo ſaith, <hi>He could not have ſuffered the curſe of the Law but as he was man.</hi> But I ſay and ſhall prove it (I hope) before I fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh this work, that if the had been no more but man, he could not have ſuffered the curſe of the Law for ſo many men.</p>
               <p>The concluſion is this, that though a creature obeyed the Law, and a creature ſuffered the curſe of it, yet the perſon that did both the one and other was not a meer creature, but more then a creature; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the righteouſneſſe of this perſon was more then a meere creature righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>But he ſaith, He made haſte to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Inſtance; and it appeares he made
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:48559:131"/> more haſte then good ſpeed, when he left the maine work behind him undone, when he did out-run the Scripture, wherein the ſtrength of the Inſtance and Argument lay; yet as haſty as he is, though I take a little more leiſure, I doubt not but to overtake him at laſt.</p>

<pb n="268" facs="tcp:48559:134"/> prerogative of God, as they conceived, but their error lay in this, they were miſtaken in him, they conceived of him that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave ſins in his own name, and by his own proper power; and he did it not, but it was done by a derived power, and in a miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall way; why was not his way of doing it cleared up to the Scribes by him? when he knew they were right in their thoughts of the thing, onely miſtook his acting, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that he acted what he did not act. But it is apparent that Chriſt doth conteſt with them upon another point, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to prove that he the Son of man (though they looked upon him as a meer man, and nothing more) was yet ſuch an one, that without blaſphemie he might take upon himſelf, as a thing ſuitable to him, and very proper to forgive ſins in that very ſenſe, as they called blaſphemie, that is, in his own name, and by his own power, and authority, without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence upon any other, to whom it more properly belonged, as they concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, in which conteſt with them he aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf to be the God to whom it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to pardon ſin: Therefore Chriſt charged them with evill thoughts of him, as it is expreſſed by <hi>Matthew</hi> in his relating
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:48559:134"/> of the ſtory, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 4. not becauſe they imagined that he exerciſed that power which he did not, <hi>viz.</hi> an abſolute independent power from himſelf, when as he onely exerciſed a delegated power which was derived to him: this was not the cauſe why Chriſt challenged them for thinking evill in their hearts, but becauſe they denied him to have that power which he had, and ſaid he blaſphemed becauſe he aſſumed it, and did ſo appropriate it to God, whom they conceived a ſpirit in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that they denied it to him in fleſh, as he was the Son of man upon earth in a ſtate of exinanition, emptied of his glory. Therefore in <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 6. and ſo in <hi>Mar.</hi> 2. 10. there is a concurrence of the Evangeliſts, that Chriſt to convince them of their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, in reſtraining and ſtraightning him in his power, which they would grant to God, but not to him, ſpeaks theſe words; <hi>But that you may know that the Son of man on earth, hath power to forgive ſins; I ſay unto thee, ariſe,</hi> &amp;c. If that had not been the Scribes and Phariſees errors, that they granted that to God, which they denied to him, he ſhould rather have uſed other words then thoſe words that he did; and have ſaid rather, <hi>that you may know, I do not</hi>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:48559:135"/> 
                  <hi>aſſume that power which you think I do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume;</hi> for ſuch words as theſe would have ſuited the Tenent of my Antagoniſt bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the error of the Scribes, had that been their error: But Chriſt conteſts with them about power, and will make them know that he had a power which they would not grant him, but called it blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie, even the very power of God, though he be alſo the Son of man on earth. And therefore he uſeth theſe words, <hi>That ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth.</hi> This conteſt of Chriſt with the Scribes puts it out of doubt that Chriſt challenged to be principall and equal with the Father in pardoning ſin, and would not own himſelf to be miniſteriall or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall therein.</p>
               <p>2. It appears by this, that Chriſt is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall in forgiving, becauſe the Scribes, and Phariſees, had no ſooner conceived thoughts of a difference betwixt God and him, denying him to be God, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him with blaſphemie for aſſuming that power which was peculiar to God: but while ſuch imaginations were in their hearts, Chriſt (before they could or did ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them) did diſcover them, and reprove
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:48559:135"/> them: and therein Chriſt gave a ſigne to them, that they had evill thoughts of him while they looked upon him as leſſe then God, or as below God; for they might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute themſelves in their own falſe conceits of Chriſt. After this manner do we charge this perſon with blaſpemie, becauſe he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives ſins being but a man, and not God, as we have thought, and yet he knows the thoughts of our hearts, and diſcovers that which we had only conceived, and had not uttered, and who can do ſuch a thing as this, but God? Whether is it eaſier to ſay thy ſins are forgiven thee, or to ſay, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think you evill in your hearts? when we expreſſed nothing with our lips. Is it not as great a work to know the heart, as to forgive ſins? Doth not <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeak to God after this manner, <hi>Thou onely knoweſt the hearts of the children of men,</hi> 2 Chron. 6. 30. Certainly, this perſon (though in fleſh) is notwithſtanding more then fleſh, none other but God. Chriſt adminiſtred matter of ſuch expoſtulation to them, that they might correct their former erring thoughts. But if they were not inſtructed thereby, yet we ſhould underſtand what thence may be collected. The ſame perſon forgave ſins as diſcerned hearts: but Chriſt
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:48559:136"/> not as man, but as God, diſcerned hearts; therefore not as man, but as God he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave ſins. Nor can it be ſaid that Chriſt knew their thoughts, becauſe God reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to him, or becauſe they gave ſome ſignes what imaginations were in them; for <hi>Mark</hi> declares that Chriſt knew what they thought in and from his own Spirit, that is, by himſelf, and not from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; therefore he forgave ſins by and from himſelf, and not by or from any other, <hi>Mark</hi> 2. 8.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is manifeſt from the Miracle that Chriſt wrought, that Chriſt was principall in forgiving, and that by and from himſelf he did it, and not by power derived to him, for he wrought the Miracle authoritative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and by his own power, he did not work it in his Fathers name, that is, by way of dependence upon him, and by prayer to his Father, as ſometimes he did when he would ſhew his manhood, that he was the Son of man, as wel as the Son of God, but he wrought it by command, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in his own name, <hi>I ſay unto thee ariſe, take up thy bed and walk;</hi> and this authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive command cameforth of his mouth, was effectual before their eyes, for this end, that he might confute thoſe evil thoughts they
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:48559:136"/> had conceived and harboured in their hearts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, <hi>viz.</hi> that he had blaſphemed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being but a man, he had arrogated and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed that power to himſelf, which is proper to God. Had this been the Scribes and Phariſees errour, that they thought he took to himſelf that power which indeed he did not, <hi>viz.</hi> an abſolute and independent power in remitting ſins, and yet it was but a derived power which he had from another, and that it was not his own which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed then in the working of this miracle, that they might know that they erred in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions concerning his manner of working; he ſhould at this time eſpecially, rather then at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, by invocation upon his Father have ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected it. And the reaſon is, becauſe Chriſts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne was in working this miracle, to teach them ſomewhat which they underſtood not, and to rectifie their apprehenſions concerning himſelf, as theſe words import, <hi>That ye may know that the Sonne of man hath power on earth to forgive ſins. I ſay unto thee who art ſick, &amp;c. ariſe and walk.</hi> Now what was it that he would teach them? was this it, that he did act dependently upon his Father, and had no ſuch power of his own to forgive ſins, but derived it from his Father? If ſo, was this the means or the way to convince them of it, to command in his own name the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent man that was ſick of ſo deadly a diſeaſe, to ariſe and walk, without any looking up to
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:48559:137"/> heaven, or groaning in his ſpirit, or ſpeaking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God his Father to effect it in him or by him? Was it not rather the way to confirme them in their errour (if that were their errour) then to bring them to the knowledg of the truth? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is manifeſt and clear that he would teach them ſome other thing wherein indeed they er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and ſtood in need to be rectified; they thought him but a man, and that he uſurped that power which belonged not unto him, but was proper to God, and that was to forgive ſinnes in his own name, and not miniſterially, but by and from himſelf; this they called blaſphemy. Now he would in this rectifie their erring judgements, by working a miracle in his own name, and by a commanding word, accompanied with anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble power; and therefore ſaith, <hi>That you may know that the Son of man,</hi> even he himſelf hath <hi>power</hi> in himſelf, and not derived from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>to forgive ſins</hi> I ſay, even I ſpeak it as one that have authority in my ſelf, and need not to ſeek out to any other, I ſay, <hi>ariſe and walk.</hi> This abſolute and independent way and manner of working this miracle, is a good demonſtration in what way, and after what manner he forgave ſins; and both by the one and by the other, he would convince the Scribes and Phariſees, that he (though clothed in fleſh, and appearing only as a man) was yet God, equall with his Father, and could work the ſame works of his Father.</p>
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:48559:137"/>
               <p> Now, though Chriſt ſeems to ſpeak of the act of forgiving ſins as an eaſier work then if he ſhould ſay to the ſick man, <hi>ariſe and walk,</hi> as theſe words of his ſeem to import, <hi>Whether is it eaſier,</hi> &amp;c. yet the works are both alike, though one not eaſier then the other; nor did Chriſt look upon the one as eaſier then the other, nor did the Scribes and Phariſees look upon one as eaſier then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for they look upon the act of abſolving from ſinne as proper to God; and not appertaining to man; But withall they thought that he deluded the people when he ſpake the words, <hi>thy ſins are forgiven thee,</hi> becauſe the effect was inward, and not to be diſcerned by the eyes of the body, and ſo the people could not diſcover the fraud and falſhood in working; therefore they imagined it was farre eaſier for Chriſt to ſay <hi>thy ſinnes are forgiven thee,</hi> in which he could not be detected, if the effect followed not, then for him to ſay, <hi>ariſe and walk,</hi> which if he had not had a power anſwerable to that word of command, would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcover his impoſtures, and expoſe him to ſhame and reproach; in this ſenſe it was eaſier for one that would delude, to ſay <hi>thy ſinnes are forgiven thee,</hi> then to ſay <hi>ariſe and walk;</hi> but Chriſt would ſhew that the one was as truly wrought and done as the other, and both of them done by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his Godhead.</p>
               <p>There are alſo other Scriptures which may give light, that Chriſt in forgiving ſins was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:48559:138"/> and not receiving power from another: 1. Chriſt gave power to his Diſciples, <hi>John</hi> 20. 23. (the place which he quoted) to remit ſins, effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually, ſo &amp; as that they ſhould be remitted and to retaine ſins effectually, and ſo as that they ſhould be retained. Now this power of delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting power to others, doth ſhew a power reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in Chriſt himſelf, and doth ſhew that Chriſt is the principall Lord againſt whom ſins are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, becauſe he both conveyes a power to the Apoſtles, and doth ratifie the exerciſe of it. 2. The Apoſtle forgave ſins in the perſon of Chriſt in 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 2. 10. that is, he did it inſtrumentally and repreſentatively, and in the name of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other who was chief in it, and that was Chriſt. It is not ſaid in the perſon of God, as it ſhould have been ſaid, if Chriſt had not been God, and principall in that power of forgiving.</p>
               <p>But he ſaith, <hi>It cannot be, becauſe the Scripture cannot oppoſe it ſelf.</hi> And he preſents what Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Tels us, <hi>The Scripture</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>tels us that we are justified by the man Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Acts 13 38, 39. <hi>be it known unto you men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, and by him all that do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve are juſtified, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> The Scripture tels us, that through the man Chriſt we are juſtified, but the Scripture tels us not that we are juſtified by Chriſt as man; It is a granted thing by us all, that the perſon that
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:48559:138"/> juſtifies us is man (for we ſay he is both God and Man) But that he juſtifies as man, or remits ſinnes as man, is denyed by us, and the contrary hath already been proved; I have ſhewed before that the Sonne of man is ſaid to be heaven, which was impoſſible, becauſe he was on earth when he ſpake theſe words; the words are therefore thus to be underſtood, the perſon, that is, the Sonne of man, being alſo God, was in heaven at that time, but not as the Sonne of man, but as God, ſo in this place it is to be underſtood.</p>
               <p>There is ſome difference to be made in Chriſts juſtifying of us. If we ſpeak of the meritorious cauſe of Juſtification, whole Chriſt, and the whole of Chriſt doth concurre in it, contribute to it, and effect it for God (looking upon that which was done and ſuffered, and upon the perſon, <hi>(viz.</hi> the excellency and glory of the perſon) that did it, and ſuffered it; in which, both the Godhead and the manhood acted the one by obeying, the other by enabling and preſenting as his (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was) (the union betwixt the two natures conſidered) pronounced beleevers juſt upon that account. Not that the manhood of Chriſt meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but the whole of Chriſt acted in thoſe things wher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>in the merit was. But if we ſpeak of the efficient cauſe of juſtification, or of pardon of ſinne, Chriſt conſidered in his divine nature as God only is agent in it, becauſe he alone againſt whom ſinne is committed, can from and by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:48559:139"/> acquit and diſchare therefrom; and ſo Chriſt as God can only do it, and he did it as God, as I have proved from <hi>Mark</hi> 22. 10.</p>
               <p>I conceive that in this Text Chriſt is not ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of as the efficient, from whom juſtification and pardon of ſins comes, but as Mediator through whom, or as the means and merit by whom forgiveneſſe of ſinnes comes; in which ſenſe it is ſaid that Chriſt was the Lamb of God which took away the ſinnes of the world. My reaſon is, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>through this man is preached forgiveneſſe, and by him all that beleeve are juſtified,</hi> not efficiently, but mediatoriouſly and meritoriouſly. It is not ſaid he pardoned ſin, but through him pardon was preached; nor is it ſaid he juſtified, but through him are juſtified thoſe that beleeve; that is, through him as the meanes; and herein the manhood is not to be excluded from acting in thoſe works which God accounts for a beleevers righteouſneſſe, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to which God juſtifies; but principally, yea ſolely to be acknowledged, but ſo farre as concernes the reſpect that God gives to ſuch acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the acceptance that they find with God, which is this, <hi>viz.</hi> God imputes them unto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers as their righteouſneſſe, and for the ſake of them doth pardon their ſins; the manhood is not at all herein to be mentioned. But nothing that can be anſwered to this can reach the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, becauſe this text was impertinent, and I
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:48559:139"/> might have paſſed it by, without giving any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to it, becauſe Chriſts pardoning of ſinne in way of efficiency, is that which the Inſtance or Argument which I produced, intends and proves, and this Scripture diſables it not, becauſe it ſpeaks of another thing, and not of that.</p>
               <p>But he goes on, and tels us what Scripture ſaith farther, <hi>viz. That Christ prayed to another</hi> (on the Jewes befalfe) <hi>for the forgiveneſſe of ſinne, Luke</hi> 23. 34. <hi>Then ſaid Jeſus, Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.</hi> Therefore Chriſt is not the principall forgiver of ſins, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> Chriſt prayed to another, <hi>viz</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for the forgiveneſſe of ſin, and another prayed to him for the pardon of ſin, <hi>viz. Stephen,</hi> and the Jewes were the ſubjects that were pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for in both; What muſt then be ſaid to this? and what anſwer is to be given to it? Alas it is not difficult to ſpeak to it. The Scripture hath clearly untyed the knot; If Chriſt were not a man, he could not pray to another; and if he were nothing more then a man, another could not pray to him; and the Scripture declares both, while it ſhewes him to be God and man. As man therefore he humbles himſelf, he prayes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him that was God. It was a time of Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to Chriſt, and this was an action of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation in Chriſt, but as God he was prayed to by him that was a man, and with adoration alſo,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:48559:140"/> though he was in heaven in reference to his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, he veiled his Godhead when he prayed to God; <hi>Stephen</hi> unveiled it, when he prayed to him. So that there is no good conſequence in this, that becauſe both the Scripture and himſelf do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare him to be man in his praying for the pardon of ſins, therefore Scripture and himſelf have deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to be God in his pardoning of mens ſins.</p>
               <p>His third Scripture is <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 30, 31. <hi>The God of our fathers raiſed up Jeſus, whom ye ſlew and hanged on a tree, him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance unto Iſrael, and forgiveneſſe of ſins;</hi> Hence he collects that Chriſt received from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other his power of forgiving ſins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> This Scripture ſeems to favour his opinion more then any that he hath alledged, and it hath the moſt ſeeming ſtrength in it for his purpoſe. But this anſwer may be returned unto it. Chriſt doth fall under a double conſideration in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he may be looked upon abſolutely as the Son of God, and ſecond perſon in the Trinity, as <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> very God; or he may be looked upon relatively, as <gap reason="foreign">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mmanuel,</hi> God with us, or in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as God manifeſt in the fleſh, and as ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, and executing the office of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator. If he be conſidered in the former accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he is eſſentially Lord; and that one Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver in all the creatures are the works of his giver
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:48559:140"/> hands, and ſubject to him, and every tranſgreſſion and ſinne that is committed, is againſt him; and it belongs to him with the Father and the holy Ghoſt (who are one God with himſelf) to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſinne, to acquit from the guilt, and to deliver from the curſe thereof, becauſe he can turn away his wrath, and hath power over all plagues, and can ſave from them, and ſo he receives no power to forgive ſins, but it belongs to him and cannot be ſeparated from his Godhead, but is naturally, eſſentially and eternally his. But if he be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the latter acception, then many things are derived to him, as the office of Mediatorſhip, and a Lordſhip, and the name Saviour is given him upon that account, which is a name above every name of the Creatures, and Prince and Captaine of our ſalvation, is a name put upon him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to him; in this ſenſe it is given to him to give repentance unto Iſrael and remiſſion of ſins. Now it muſt be underſtood as I have expreſſed in my former Treatiſe, that the giving of theſe things doth not deny any intrinſecall or inward perfection which Chriſt hath, but rather ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it; and it muſt be granted, that Chriſt, to whom theſe things are given, according to his due nature, hath all his perfection with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the gift of theſe, and that theſe are but declarative, and ſerve to manifeſt that eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall riches and glory which he had with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from eternity, and that his naturall Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:48559:141"/> and Lordſhip (which cannot be ſeparated from his Deity) is that which founds ſuch dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and gifts which are too high for any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and would carry away Divine glory from him, who is God, if they ſhould be given to any meere creature, and they are to be exerciſed by the help of the Godhead of Chriſt, elſe they could not be acted by him, as being too great for any man or meere creature. Indeed the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity hath fellowſhip with the Godhead in the glory of the having and executing theſe things; and to the manhood it is glory derived, which was not before, but to the Deity of Chriſt it is glory manifeſted and declared only.</p>
               <p>More particularly, It is given to Chriſt as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator to diſpenſe pardon of ſin, and it belongs to his Prieſt-hood to do it. The Prieſts of the Law they did it, externally and miniſterially, figurative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and typically; they pronounced clean and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, ſo farre as concerned the fleſh; but Chriſt did it, and doth it effectually, and ſpiritually, pronouncing and diſcharging the conſcience from all ſinne; and what was the reaſon of this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence? They did it as men, therefore in weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and could ſpeak, but were not able to effect what they ſpake; but Chriſt did it as the Sonne of God, yea as the eternall Son of God, as the Apoſtle teſtifies, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 3. So that the very Prieſt-hood of Chriſt, that it might be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall in the works of it (and this of pardoning
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:48559:141"/> of ſin, was one of them) was founded in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Son-ſhip of Chriſt, and therein lay this ability and power to performe the works of it, and principally this work of remitting ſinnes: So that though the way of diſpenſing pardon be given to Chriſt, yet the power of diſpenſing was not given, but is as ancient as his Son-ſhip; therefore he erres in his inference which he fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from this Text of <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 31. When he ſaith, <hi>that he received from another his power of forgiving ſins:</hi> For it was not power that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, but the way of exerciſing of it. It is acted in the fleſh as Mediator, even ſince Chriſt came in the fleſh, and now the Son of man, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives ſinnes, that is, the perſon that is man and the ſon of man forgives, but not as he is man or the ſon of man, but as he is God and the Son of God. For though it may be ſaid that the Mediator pardoneth ſin efficiently, as well as Meritoriouſly, as Prieſt; yet it cannot be ſaid that the whole of the Mediator doth it, but the divine nature alone acts in it. It may be ſaid of a man who conſiſts of ſoul and body, that he me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditateth, but it cannot be ſaid of the whole of man that he meditateth, but of the minde only. It may alſo be ſaid of of him that he walketh; but it is to be underſtood of his body only, and not of his minde, yet becauſe of the union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt body and ſoul (both of them making but one man) what either doth is attributed to the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:48559:142"/> whole. So it is with Chriſt our Mediator, he bore our ſinnes as man only, for the God-head could not ſuffer, he purged away our ſinnes as God-man: for the man-hood acted, and the God-head merited, he pardoned ſin as God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe he is ſupream Lord only as he is God: yet the Mediator doth all theſe, that is, he that is both God and man doth them; but in this different way he doth them. And ſo it appears that ſtill he is the principall in this work of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving ſins, becauſe he doth it as God, and that this gift (which reſpects not the power it ſelf of diſpenſing, but the way only of diſpenſing doth adde nothing to the intrinſicall perfection of Chriſt, but is manifeſtive of that inward eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all glory, which he had with the Father before any beginning was, which was vailed by Chriſts aſſuming fleſh, and yet manifeſted in fleſh, by acts which were too high for fleſh, of which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture this of pardoning ſin was one.</p>
               <p>The concluſion is this, the work of forgiving ſin is high and glorious, proper and peculiar, and ſuitable to this great and moſt high God, Jeſus Chriſt; the Mediatorly the way of diſpenſing it is below this excellent perſon Chriſt, who is not only the ſon of the higheſt, but the higheſt, and it was the humbling and debaſing and empty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of himſelf to act ſuch a work in ſuch a way.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply,</hi> There is nothing in the place which he hath directed me to, <hi>viz. Rom.</hi> 5. 15. which he hath or can fetch out with all his conſideration that will anſwer my Querie. His asking of an other queſtion will be no anſwer to mine. <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne might make many tranſgreſſours, upon that account, as no mans righteouſneſſe can ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them (being tranſgreſſours) righteous and juſt perſons. 1. All perſons which afterward ſprung from him, were in his loyns at that time when he ſinned, and were parts of him, and conſequently they ſinned in him, and with him, his ſinne was their ſinne, it extended unto them, and they could not but participate of it, as of <hi>Levi</hi> it is ſaid, that he paid tythes in <hi>Abrahams</hi> loynes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 9, 10.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Adams</hi> ſtate in which he ſtood, when the
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:48559:143"/> whole world was in him, was a ſtate of grace and favour with God, from which (if he ſinned) himſelf was to fall and all his poſterity with him; after the manner of ſome perſons that holds an eſtate, upon the good will of their Lord, whom if they offend they are caſt out and all their poſterity with them, for that is the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon which it is given to be poſſeſſed, and the children and off-ſpring are in volved in the guilt of ſuch perſons treſpaſſes, whoſe favour is on ſuch termes; God is to be looked upon as ſoveraigne Lord of all creatures, to whom it belongs to ſhew favour to what creatures he will, and upon what termes he will, and under what conditions he pleaſeth, and under what pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties (in caſe of tranſgreſſion) liketh him; therefore it was that he ſet <hi>Adam</hi> over the works of his hands, entred into a conditionall League and Covenant with him, and did both priviledge him, and reſtrain him, and abridge him therein; and this was done under penalty of dying, both to him and his, in caſe of treſpaſſe, <hi>thou ſhalt dye the death</hi> (ſaith God) to him. And thus it came, that through the offence of one, many are dead.</p>
               <p>3. Sinne was propagated and generated to and in <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity, after that <hi>Adam</hi> fell, and loſt Gods image. It is ſaid of him that begat a ſon after his own image, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. 3. And ſo all perſons came to be conceived in iniquity, and to
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:48559:144"/> be borne in ſin, for out of an unclean thing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is clean can proceed. And ſo it comes to paſſe, that <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne made many tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours; for by propagation all men have ſins of their own (over and above the ſinne of <hi>Adam,)</hi> imputed to them. Thus the paſſage of ſin and death, from one <hi>Adam</hi> to all men, appears facile and eaſie; there is no obſtruction in the way, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty and holineſſe and juſtice, and truth furthered it, effected it.</p>
               <p>But now in reference to Chriſt it cannot be thus aſſerted, that righteouſneſſe paſſeth upon men after this manner. 1. Righteouſneſſe is not propagated at all, but only imputed. 2. It is not by participation, becauſe none are in Chriſts loynes by nature: Chriſt hath no naturall ſeed, that are parts of him. 3. If there be any ſuch relation betwixt Chriſt and men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as that Chriſt ſhould be a father to them, and they children to him, that he ſhould be as a ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> it is not unto all, but to thoſe only that beleeve and this is alſo meerely through grace, and ſo there may be an imputation of righteouſneſſe from one to many, but it is through grace. Therefore it is ſaid, the grace of God hath abounded by one man unto many: Not unto all men, but to all that receive it, that do beleeve, <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. 4. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be imputed through grace, there comes to be an obſtruction to it; juſtice and truth muſt be ſatisfied, before there be any place for grace;
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:48559:144"/> and if grace cannot paſſe, the gift of grace which is righteouſneſſe and life to men through Chriſt, cannot paſſe neither. And ſo it appears that the way of ſins paſſing is more ready from one man to many, then the way of righteouſneſſe aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding through one to many. Becauſe of ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that muſt interpoſe, that grace may have a free and open paſſage unto many. 5, If it be through ſatisfaction, that muſt interpoſe, before the grace of God, and the gift by grace can by one abound to many; and if firſt the ſins of thoſe many, that grace abounds to, through one, muſt be laid upon that one, that that one might bear the curſe of the Law, that by this means the grace of deliverance (which conſiſts in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe imputed, and in life,) might paſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, through that one, and abound to thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, (as he himſelf (though ſomewhat darkely) doth confeſſe) then this one man (through whom grace muſt abound to many) cannot be any one, but ſuch an one who is able to give ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for many. And concerning this ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction the querie is made, how it could be that any one meer man could ſatisfie for the ſinnes of many tranſgreſſours; and the diſproportion is pleaded: <hi>No proportion betwixt one meer man dying for ſin, and many men ſinning and deſerving death, each of them for the ſins they have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi> But he makes no anſwer at all unto it, but ſends me to <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 15. to anſwer my ſelf, which
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:48559:145"/> ſleight proceedings will ſatisfie none but ſuch who are willing to be deluded by him.</p>
               <p>The queſtion only will be, what ſatisfaction is neceſſary, that grace may abound to many? Becauſe there be many that conceive that any ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction will ſerve (to make man capable of grace) which God will accept, and they do not look at proportion. And there are others that hold that no ſatisfaction at all is neceſſary, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of God, becauſe God having loved the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, loves them for ever, and there is no change at all in Gods love, nor is God capable of chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but is immutable in his nature; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though man ſinned, yet his love was not broken off thereby; nor was there any breach on his part at all, nor did Chriſt dye to ſatisfie him at all; for he was ſatisfied always in his own love, which continued the ſame after man had ſinned as before; for in his love he gave Chriſt after man had tranſgreſſed; therefore the breach was on mans part; he had wronged God, and merited nothing but hatred, and wrath, and all evill, and no love at all; and having an evil and guilty conſcience, he was ſuſpicious of God, and expected no good from him, but feared all evil, and could not conceive how God could love ſuch a creature, or ſhew any grace or favour to him, that had ſinned in ſuch ſort againſt him; and knew not how God could do it without ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; Thus unſatisfied was mans conſcience
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:48559:145"/> (having ſinned) concerning the finding of any mercy from Gods hands; therefore God gave Chriſt and delivered him up to death, and layed him under the curſe of the Law, not to ſatisfie himſelf thereby, but to ſatisfie mans conſcience, and to give reſt and quiet to it, and that God cared not for a few drops of bloud, but there was a wound in the conſcience of thoſe that had ſinned, that would not be healed but by ſuch a manifeſtation of the Fathers love, as in giving Chriſt, and delivering him up for ſuch, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And ſome ſay Chriſt came to reveal the Fathers councells, and dyed for the confirmation of them. This opinion takes hold of many, and ſpreads and prevailes much; my deſigne is not to make a large diſcourſe in way of anſwer, becauſe it is beſide my preſent undertaking; only becauſe I am neceſſitated (in reply to him) to inſiſt a little on the point of ſatisfaction, and becauſe the point is of great concernment, I ſhall not overſleightly paſſe over it, but ſtay a while in anſwer to both the forementioned Tenents, and ſhall firſt ſhew that ſome ſatisfaction to God is neceſſary, and then declare what it is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> And firſt I ſhall premiſe ſome things, and afterward lay down ſome poſitions.</p>
               <p>That which is to be premiſed, is: 1. That there are no paſſions and affections in God, after the manner of men; there is neither love nor hatred, nor wrath, nor anger, nor joy, nor
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:48559:146"/> grief, nor any ſuch by which the mindes and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of men are moved and diſturbed; for God had all things before him at firſt that ſhould come to paſſe afterward; and if it were good, it was of his own operation; and if it were evill, it was of his own permiſſion and ordering alſo, and that which he could eaſily have prevented. So that it is irrationall to conceive that God ſhould be ſtirred or moved with any thing that comes to paſſe, or that he ſhould be in divers tempers or mindes, or that he ſhould be one thing to day, and an other thing to morrow; this is inconſiſtent to that abſolute bleſſedleſſe of God; therefore though theſe things are ſpoken of God in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, yet they be <hi>humanitus dicta,</hi> they be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to God after the manner of men. And thoſe things that are paſſions and affections in men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are attributes and decrees, and counſels, and actions and operations in God; and imply not the leaſt mutation or change in God. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple, Gods loving of <hi>Jacob</hi> before he had done good to deſerve ſuch a thing, what was it but Gods goodneſſe and graciouſneſſe; which is an attribute in God, noted in decreeing <hi>Iacob</hi> to glory, which is called Election; and Gods hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to <hi>Eſau</hi> before he had done evill, what was it but his ſoveraignty and abſolute domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which God hath over the creatures, without being capable to give any account, exerciſed i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="293" facs="tcp:48559:146"/> they are not paſſions and affections in God, but they are acts of the unchangeable will of God, in which the above mentioned properties in God are expreſſed. And Gods wrath and anger is not a paſſion in God, but it is an act of Gods righteouſneſſe and juſtice, by which he repells that which is evill in the creature, and contrary to his own holineſſe, in teſtification of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitableneſſe of it to him, and of that which he juſtly expects from the creature.</p>
               <p>2. There is difference to be put betwixt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree and purpoſe of God, concerning life and glory, in reference to ſuch perſons whom he will glorifie goodneſſe towards, and the way and means by which God will effect it and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh it, which is in advancing holineſſe and righteouſneſſe; in order to which he made the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> after his image, gave him an holy and righteous nature, writte his will in his heart, and then entred into a Covenant of life and peace, and glory with him upon the obſervation of his will; and threatened death, and all evil, and miſery, upon the violation thereof; and this Covenant was in reference to himſelf, and his poſterity that were in his loyns. This latter is called in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture the way of peace and life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 16, 17. The former is hid in God; for who hath been of his counſell, or who knoweth further then he reveals? and it hath its being in God, and no where elſe. The latter is declared to the creature
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:48559:147"/> and it is the creatures capacity of life, or the viſible ſtate of life into which God did put him, and it hath its being in the creature.</p>
               <p>3. There is difference to be put betwixt the love of God to the creature, and the amity of God with the creature; or betwixt the decree of grace in electing the creature to life and glory, &amp; the proſecution of the decree in ſuteable and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable actings of God toward the creature.</p>
               <p>If there be a right diſtinguiſhing betwixt theſe things that thus differ, theſe following propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and concluſions will be better underſtood and more eaſily granted.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When ſin was committed againſt God, the love of God was not broken off, nor the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, purpoſe and thoughts of God, concerning glorifying of ſuch perſons whom he had choſen to life and glory, were not altered, nor changed; for this foundation ſtands ſure, the Lord know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth who are his, nor is God in this ſence like man that he ſhould repent: Thoſe whom he thus loveth, he loveth to the end, that is, he cannot caſt off whom he hath choſen. For theſe councells of grace concerning theſe perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without reſpect either to good or evill in the perſons themſelves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 11. The good or evill that followed them in ſuch perſons, could neither confirme them nor overturne them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſtand upon this baſis, the immutable and unchangable Will of God, not upon the
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:48559:147"/> uncertain and wavering creature; and hence it came to paſſe, that when one means of effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, <hi>viz</hi> mans own righteouſneſſe proved ineffectual, God (to ſhew his firmeneſſe in his Councels) found out other means to accompliſh them by <hi>viz.</hi> the righteouſneſſe of another, and therefore gave Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 3. 16.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though ſinne did not, could not overturn the Decree of life, yet it broke the Covenant of life, and ſo overthrew that viſible ſtate of life in which the elect were, whom God had choſen; and ſo brought them into a dreadfull viſible ſtate of death, though not into a final miſerable ſtate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of Gods election. Sin altered the ſtate of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect perſons, though it altered not Gods thoughts concerning them; ſo that it might be ſaid, he that was before in the ſtate of ſalvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is now through ſin in the ſtate of condemnation; though it cannot be ſaid that God will (becauſe of ſin) now damn that perſon, whom his thought and purpoſe was to have ſaved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 11. <hi>Deſtruction and miſery is in their paths;</hi> and ver. 23. <hi>All have ſinned and fallen ſhort of the glory of God</hi> and Rom. 5. 12. <hi>As by one man ſin entred into the world, and death by ſin, ſo death paſſed over all men, becauſe all had ſinned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Sin having overthrown the Covenant of life and glory, and brought men into the ſtate of death, all hope and expectation of life was (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with it) taken away, and nothing but a fearfull expectation of death and condemnation.
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:48559:148"/> It is ſaid of <hi>Adam</hi> when he had ſinned, that he hid himſelf from God, when God came into the Garden, as one that expected no good from Cod. We read of the condition of the elect, before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, that <hi>through fear of death they were all their life ſubject to bondage.</hi> This is to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretend in reference to their conſciences, which tormented them with the repreſentations of death; but this will be granted, that Chriſt came to ſatisfie the conſcience and quiet, it, but not to ſatisfie God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Though the election of God ſtand ſure, and the ſove of God could not be broken off, yet the amity and friendſhip of God was brought to an end, and wrath was manifeſted inſtead of love, and God inſtead of proſecuting his Decree of life, proſecutes the breach of the Covenant of life, which was violated by ſin; and ratifies the threatning, which was this, <hi>thou ſbalt ſurely die;</hi> and doth unfold the curſe in it, and open it in ſome part of its latitude, which was ſhut up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe generall words, <hi>thou ſhalt die,</hi> Gen. 3. 16. to 20. And <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 3. Elect perſon are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Children of wrath,</hi> as well as the reprobate; they are in one ſtate till deliverance come. And 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 10. Jeſus is ſaid to deliver us from wrath to come. Now wrath is not a paſſion in God, as I have ſhewed, but it is Gods righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe conflicting with, and proſecuting ſinne, <hi>viz.</hi> the firſt ſin, in the violation of the Covenant of of
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:48559:148"/> life, and all after ſins alſo; And ſuch which ſinne, are accurſed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. that being the ſentence of the Law, is the ſentence of God, whoſe the Law is, ſo that God as a Judge proſecuting ſinne on the Lawes behalf, is repreſented unto us.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If God muſt be a righteous and juſt God, and faithfull and true God, he muſt be (even he himſelf) the proſecutor of the Elect, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his Decree of life and glory, in which he had comprehended them, wherein his goodnes freely wrought from all eternity towards them; becauſe God had threatned, and muſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe it, leaſt he ſuffer in his truth, leaſt his word be falſified, which was, that <hi>Adam</hi> tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his Commandement ſhould ſurely die; and the law ſaith, <hi>That that ſoule that ſins ſhall die;</hi> His truth therefore binds him to it; God muſt be true and every man a liar, that contradicts him in that which he ſpeaks. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of ſome perſons, <hi>That knew the judgement of God, that they that commit ſuch things are worthy of death;</hi> He had mentioned many ſins which men committed, and brings in the knowledge that they had of the demerit of ſuch ſins againſt them, that ſuch ſins were worthy of death; and that it might not be thought that they judged theſe ſins worthy of death, through the working of their conſciences only, the Apoſtle ſhews that they had the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the judgement of God, and that
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:48559:149"/> thence it was that they judged theſe ſins wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of death. Now the judgement of God is according to righteouſneſſe; therefore Juſtice preſſeth God on to a proſecuting where ever ſin is.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Though God, becauſe he hath choſen ſome to life, will not ſuffer them to periſh, but will bring them to life everlaſting, and though he love them ſo well, that to ſave them he will give Chriſt to them and for them, as from <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. is manifeſt he doth; yet in the giving of Chriſt he will have ſuch reſpect to his juſtice and to his truth, that neither of them may be violated or wronged. Hereto the Apoſtle gives witneſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25, 26. God hath, ſaith he, ſet forth Chriſt to declare his righteouſneſſe, that he might be juſt, and the juſtifier of them that beleeve in Jeſus. God had regard to both theſe in ſending and ſetting forth Chriſt, that he might juſtifie thoſe that he had choſen, and had brought to faith; and that he might be juſt in ſo doing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſinne that ſuch had commited, or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipated in, was worthy of death by Gods owne dome; therefore God minds both, that goodneſs and righteouſneſſe might be exalted together in the ſame Chriſt. So in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. 13. God had an eye to his truth; when he gave Chriſt; it was written in the Law, <hi>that he that continued not in all things contained there, was accurſed;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no man did continue in all things written
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:48559:149"/> there, that God in the Law might be true, Chriſt (whom Gods electing love gave to the elect) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came accurſed for them. Chriſt therefore died not for any ſuch end as to ratifie the doctrine which he had brought from the Father; for by his miracles he gave ſufficient witneſſe thereto, nor is this made the end of Chriſts dying any where in Scripture; but it was to appeaſe God, and to fulfill righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Gods laying the ſinnes of the Elect upon Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 6. was in order to ſatisfaction to God; It was not only done to aſſure us that in mercy they are taken away from us, that we might not fear, but might poſſeſſe our ſoules in quietneſſe; but it was done to aſſure us that in juſtice and righteouſneſſe they are taken away, and upon ſuch termes, as that God is no loſer, therefore they were laid upon Chriſt when he was upon the tree, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. to intimate to us that it was to that end that they were laid upon him, that he might there and then ſatisfie for them; in which regard it is ſaid in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 5. <hi>that he was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, he was bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for our iniquities, the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him;</hi> The meaning is, he had wounds and bruiſes by chaſtiſements, which belonged to us, becauſe of our iniquities, by reaſon of which God was wrath with us, that he by enduring and bearing them might make peace for us.</p>
               <p n="8">8. It is aſſerted in Scripture that Chriſt ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:48559:150"/> for us, died for us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. and in many other places, which muſt not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood <hi>finaliter,</hi> as if we onely were the end of Chriſts ſufferings, and had onely ſome profit by them; but for us, is as much as in our ſtead; as when <hi>David</hi> ſaid of <hi>Abſolom, would God I had died for thee,</hi> that is, in thy ſtead; ſo it is to be underſtood in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 6, 7, 8. Scarcely for a righteous man would one die, that is, ſcarcely in ſtead of him, to deliver him from death; and ſo in application to Chriſt for us, is as much as in his roome, and place, and ſtead, which further appears, becauſe firſt the very evils which were due to us Chriſt endured, as firſt the wrath of God in his ſoule, ſuch which the very damned have in hell, but more intolerable; it is ſaid that his ſoul was heavy unto death, and that on a cold winters day, he did through the meere an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of his ſoule, and while he was conflicting with Gods anger, ſweat drops of water and blood, notwithſtanding all the ſupport he had, which was his fathers immediate ſtroke; for no hand was upon him at this time but Gods; and it was the torment of the mind that had ſuch an influence upon his body, for his body was put to no paine. Now this wrath was upon him, becauſe wrath was due to us, we were children of wrath, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 3. 2. He endured the curſe of the law; and was not the curſe of the law our portion for tranſgreſſion? <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 10. 3. He ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:48559:150"/> death; and was not death the wages of our ſinne? <hi>The wages of ſinne is death,</hi> ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. Secondly, Chriſt endured the very evils that were due to us, to deliver us from enduring them, as 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>He deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth us from wrath to come;</hi> it was by his bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wrath; and from the curſe he ſaves us, that is by becoming a curſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. And by death it was that he delivered us from the fear of death, to which we were in bondage, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 15. Now if he ſuffered in ſtead of us, then it was in a ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory way, becauſe our ſufferings would have been to ſatisfie the law, and Gods juſtice which is in the law; and the damned in hell do ſuffer for that reaſon, to pay that debt to juſtice, which becauſe they can never compleatly do, therefore they do ever ſuffer.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Our ſalvation which through Chriſt we partake of, is through redemption, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24. But redemption in a proper acception, hath ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in it; for it may be thus deſcribed, Redemption is a freeing a captive from the hands of him that detains him, by a price given unto him; as when a perſon is taken captive by the Turks, there is a price given to him for the freeing of ſuch a perſon. So it is in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption effected by Chriſt, on the behalfe of the Elect; and there are theſe following parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars in it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The captives that are detained in bondage
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:48559:151"/> and miſery, theſe are thoſe that were appointed unto glory before the world was, but through ſin are become captives, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 21, 22, 23. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24, 25.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The perſon that detains them in this bondage, this is God; for it is the wrath of God that holds them in it; they are the children of wrath, under the power of wrath, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 3. and they are held under it till they be delivered from it, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 9. Now wrath relates to God, as the ſubject in whom it is; for it is God that was wronged, therefore he it is that was offended, and is angry, and whoſe wrath burnes like fire, till ſatisfaction be given, and then it is turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. It is alſo the juſtice and judgment of God that detains them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 31. The conſcience of the ſinner is brought in by the Apoſtle acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the righteous judgment of God, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing unto this, <hi>that they that commit ſuch things are worthy of death.</hi> It is alſo the Law that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines them; for the Law worketh wrath, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 15. that is, the wrath of God is revealed in the Law againſt all unrighteouſneſſe of men, and this worketh diſquietneſſe in the mind; till the Law be ſatisfied, God is not ſatisfied; for the Law is Gods Law, and his righteouſneſſe in it; and till both the Law, and God the Author of it be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, the priſoner the poore captive muſt nec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. The enemies and evils under whom and

And God hath ſoveraign power over all theſe plagues and evils; for though ſome of them be Gods grand enemies, as well as ours, yet they are Gods ſervants as well as his enemies, and they do but hold men while Gods will is they ſhould, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 9. <hi>and chap.</hi> 19. 10, 15, 14. And indeed there is no reaſon but that Gods proceedings muſt be with men that have finned, as well as Angels that ſinned, till he have ſatisfaction, but he ſpared not the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels that ſinned, but caſt them down to hell, and delivered them to chains of darkneſſe to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to judgement, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4. Therefore it is he that delivers men to death, and to him that hath the power of death, that is the devil, and to hell alſo, and thoſe chains of darkneſſe, there to be reſerved, till either ſatisfaction come, or the laſt doom be paſſed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The perſon that redeems theſe captives from Gods juſt judgement, and from his wrath, and from theſe enemies and evils, and this is Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 9. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>and chap.</hi> 4. 4, 5. <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 69, 70, 71.</p>

Now that this life of Chriſt was laid down, and this blood of Chriſt was ſhed as a price to ranſome the Elect, who were Cap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tives, appears clearly from <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 28. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 6. where it is ſaid, that Chriſt laid down his down his life a ranſome for many, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And that this price was, given to God, is manifeſt alſo from the ſame place of <hi>Peter,</hi> where Chriſts blood is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the blood of an immaculate Lambe that hath no blemiſh nor ſpot; now ſuch Lambs were treſpaſſe-offerings brought to God, who was the perſon againſt whom the treſpaſſe was committed; and it was for ſatisfaction in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to ſin committed; and it pointed at Chriſt, who was indeed the Lambe of God that taken away the ſins of all Elect ones in the world, by that ſatisfaction or price which he gave in his own blood. Alſo <hi>David</hi> in his ſpeech to <hi>Saul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26. 19. gives witneſſe to this truth, that offerings were brought to God, and
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:48559:152"/> that blood was the price of redemption for ſin, given to God: <hi>If God have ſtirred thee up againſt me being offended at me,</hi> (for that is the meaning of it, <hi>let him accept an offering,</hi> that is, for ſatisfaction and pacification let him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it. But more directly and poſitively the Author to the Hebrews ſpeaks to this, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. <hi>How much more</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall the blood of Chriſt, who through the eternal ſpirit, offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf without ſpot to God, purge your conſciences, &amp;c.</hi> If then the price of redemption was given to God, God is the perſon that firſtly and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally detains the Elect as Captives in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage; for he that receives the price is he that holds us in ſuch evil condition, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is from him, that is from that in him that holds us.</p>
               <p>10. The reconciliation which Chriſt effected through his death and blood, was of God to us, as well as of us to God, which appears from <hi>Rom.</hi> 3, 25. where it is ſaid that God hath ſet Chriſt forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood. The ſenſe of the Greek word, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, is <hi>Placamentum,</hi> that by which God is appeaſed and pacified, who was angry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and gives anſwers of peace to his people, when he meets with them, as in <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. 17, 21, 22. God cauſed a Mercy-ſeat to be made, it is rendred <hi>propitiatorium,</hi> and is the ſame word with this of the Apoſtle, and he cauſed it
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:48559:153"/> to be put upon the Ark, and there he met with the people, and communed with them in a peaceable way and manner; This was this type of Chriſt, this appeaſed God ſacramentally, typically, figuratively; Chriſt properly, really, truly, by his blood, which ſpeaks better things in Gods ears, then the blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> that cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for vengeance; this cries for pardon, for peace, for reconciliation; therefore the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>If any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father who is a Propitiation for our ſins,</hi> who expiates our ſins by his blood, and ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſeth God and pacifies him. And by Chriſt it is ſaid that we receive the attonement that is with God, or we have God attoned to us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 11. for all the offerings of the Old Teſtament were for attonement, and the people offered them to attone him; God did not offer them to attone them or reconcile them; nor did they offer them to ſhow that they were reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to God; for they were offered immediately after they had ſinned, and had the ſenſe of their ſinne upon their conſciences, and knew they had angred God; that by offering them in a beleeving way, looking at Chriſt the ſinne-offering (which they ſignified) they might appeaſe him and paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him, and ſo might have peace in their owne hearts.</p>
               <p>But there are many objections that are framed againſt this great and weighty truth of Chriſts

               <p>It is aſſerted that redemption is taken in Scripture many times in a metaphoricall ſenſe, when only power is put forth to deliver perſons from enemies, and an evil ſtate, &amp; no price paid at all; ſo in the deliverance from <hi>Egypt,</hi> there was power exerciſed againſt <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Realm, by which <hi>Iſrael</hi> was fetched out from bondage, but no price paid to any, yet it is called re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption in many places, and <hi>Moſes</hi> a Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 35. And becauſe this deliverance from <hi>Egypt</hi> was a type of the ſpiritual delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance which comes by Chriſt, and <hi>Moſes</hi> a type of Chriſt in this deliverance, therefore the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance which is effected by Chriſt, is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by any price paid to God, but in a

               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Though redemption be taken metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically in ſome places of Scriptures, yet it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not it ſhould be taken ſo in all places; and though external deliverances are many times by power only, and without price, it will not therefore follow that this great ſpiritual and eternal deliverance muſt be a deliverance of the ſame kind; And though this temporal delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from <hi>Egypt</hi> be a type of this ſpiritual by Chriſt from ſin, and death, and hell: yet it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not that therefore there muſt be a ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and parity in all things betwixt them; and though <hi>Moſes</hi> be a type of Chriſt, yet the type reacheth not the perfection of the thing typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; it is clear in the perſon of <hi>Moſes</hi> compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the perſon of Chriſt: and it is as clear in the redemption that <hi>Moſes</hi> effected from God, which was from outward ſervitude and bondage, and that redemption which was wrought by Chriſt, which was from hell and from the devil. There are many diſſimilitudes betwixt the one redemption and the other; and this is one, that there is no price paid in the one but power uſed, but in the other there was both. And to convince of this the better, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, the one was without blood, for there needed none; but the other muſt be with blood,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:48559:155"/> for there could be no remiſſion without it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 22. The one was without the intervening of the Redeemer, in the place and room of the redeemed; <hi>Moſes</hi> was not to be in bondage, in the room and &amp; place ſtead of thoſe that were by him to be redeemed from bondage; but in this ſpiritual deliverance it muſt be ſo; the Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er muſt be in the condition that the redeemed were in; Chriſt muſt come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the room of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and muſt bear their ſins, and ſuffer their plagues inſtead of them, as hath been proved. And the reaſon of this difference is, becauſe <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> had not in the redemption of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> any thing to do with an offended God, who had a controverſie againſt the people whom <hi>Moſes</hi> was to redeem, and from whom he would have ſatisfaction before he would ſave them; for then in ſuch a caſe againſt the enemy that held them, power would not have been ſufficient for their deliverance, but a price would have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; but Chriſt in his redemption hath to do with Gods wrath, and anger, and with Gods righteouſneſſe, which were ſhewed and reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the Elect; for the Elect had ſinned, whom he was to redeem; and God had threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned they ſhould die the death, and they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it, and God muſt be juſt and true in what he had ſaid; therefore Chriſt muſt firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with God in the deliverance of this people, before he could exerciſe any power agalnſt the
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:48559:156"/> devil, or death, or hell; and this prevailing muſt be by a price paid to ſatisfie for tranſgreſſion; for it could not be by power; God might be appeaſed, but overcome he could not be, as thoſe enemies muſt, whom he was to deliver the Elect from. THis hath all been ſhewed already, and this is it that makes the diſparity betwixt the two deliverances which do typifie one the other.</p>

               <p>Though Redemption be from Sin, Satan, the world, death, hell, and all ſuch enemies and evils, yet it is to be underſtood, that it is from theſe only as the leſſe principal cauſes of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of Gods Elect in bondage; even as when a perſon is delivered from the Gaole, he is delivered from the Gaoler, &amp; from the daungeon or pit into which he was caſt, and from his bolts, and chains, and from all the noiſomeneſſe, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, and naſtineſſe, that attends that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; yet theſe are but the leſſe principal cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the evils; he is firſtly and principally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from his Creditor and the Judge, that committed him to theſe; So it is in this caſe; God is the principal perſon that detains, and the reſt that are mentioned in Scripture are but his ſervants. The devil is as the officer that receives perſons that are ſentenced of God into his cuſtody; ſin is but as the fetters and cords in which ſuch perſons are held, the world is but as the priſon, and death is but as the torments perſons are put to; but properly we are Gods Captives, and are doomed and ſentenced of God to baniſhment from his preſence, as <hi>Cain</hi> was, and are delivered up to the power and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:48559:157"/> of the God of this world; For 1. God is the Soveraign Lord, and ſupream Monarch and Judge, and the power primarily belongs to him to caſt body and ſoule into hell. 2. Men are guilty of that which they call <hi>crimen laeſae maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statis,</hi> or treaſon againſt divine Majeſty; <hi>Againſt thee, thee only I have ſinned,</hi> ſaid <hi>David,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore worthy to be rejected.</p>
               <p>3. Therefore they are by nature children of wrath, <hi>The wrath of God is revealed from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi> Upon thoſe that beleeves not, <hi>the wrath of God abides;</hi> 4. We ask to be loſed and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from our ſins, not from Satan, but from God, and to be loſed from the bonds and ſnares of hell and death; therefore primarily we are held in bondage to God, and not to Satan or any other. Hereto agrees the witneſſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>God hath ſhut up all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all,</hi> Rom. 11. 32. <hi>The Scripture,</hi> that is God in the Scripture, <hi>hath ſhut up all under ſinne, that the promiſe of faith through Ieſus Chriſt might be given unto them that beleeve,</hi> Gal. 3. 22. <hi>God gave ſome up to vile affections,</hi> Rom. 1. 26. <hi>and verſe</hi> 28. <hi>becauſe they liked not to retain God in their thoughts, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God gave them up to a reprobate mind, God gave them up to worſhip the Hoſt of Heaven,</hi> Acts 7. 42. The Parable of the King that was wrath with him that was unmerciful to his fellow-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, is pertinent to the ſame purpoſe, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:48559:157"/> him to the tormentors, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 34. And that exhortation of Chriſt, <hi>To agree with our adverſary while in the way, leſt the Judge de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver to the officer, &amp;c.</hi> Which places do all ſhew that we through ſin are primarily the Captives of God, as a King and Judge offended; and that only ſecondarily we are Captives to the devil and other enemies as to Gods Miniſters and Servants, though enemies, to which we are committed; for without commiſſion and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion we are taught, that the greateſt tyrants can effect nothing againſt Gods Elect; and the very devils themſelves, could not go into the herd of ſwine without leave; therefore the price paid to God to ſatisfie him is the principal thing in redemption.</p>
               <p>It is alſo to be underſtood, that theſe two, <hi>To be redeemed from God, and to be redeemed to God,</hi> will conſiſt very well together; for the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of the Elect, is not like the captivation of a perſon taken in war, and detained by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, from whom when he is redeemed, he is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally alienated and ſeparated, and hath no more to do with him: nor is it like the captivation of a perſon, who is violently and unjuſtly detained in the hand of a cruel one, who tyrannizeth over him after the manner of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who laid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly heavy burdens upon the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> from whom (if he be once freed) he is totally withdrawn from ſuch an one, and divided, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:48559:158"/> to come into his hands or power any more. But the captivity of the Elect is as when a ſubject for ſome offence againſt his Prince, is delivered into the Serjeants hand, or into ſome other of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers cuſtody and power, to be impriſoned, or ſcourged, or puniſhed with death, according to the nature of the offence, unleſſe ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be given, and he be releaſed upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; ſuch a redemption as this is, <hi>viz.</hi> of a ſubject from the wrath of his Prince, is not the alienation of the ſubject from his Prince, but the reconciliation of him to his Prince; and the perſon that is redeemed from, is redeemed to man; for theſe do conſiſt well enough together, from the wrath and juſtice of the Prince, to the love and favour of the Prince he is redeemed. And though God offended, doth deliver the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to enemies, and not to ſubjects; for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is an enemy both to God and to the Elect, and not a ſubject, yet this makes no difference but that the Elects captivation may fitly be reſembled captivation of a ſubject to his own Prince, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God is the Lord of devils, and they as truly ſubject, (though not as willingly ſubject) as any other that are under Gods power.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>It is further aſſerted, that it is God that gave Chriſt to redeem men, and if there be any ſatisfaction given to God by Chriſt, God himſelf is the author of it, and gave it to himſelf; if he gave it to himſelf, he was ſatisfied before,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:48559:158"/> and the price moves him nothing, to releaſe the captive, becauſe it is not from the captive, but from himſelf, and of his own providing; and nothing is added to God by it, for it is but Gods ſatisfying of himſelf. And what a kinde of ſatisfaction is this? In the truth of the thing it is as no ſatisfaction; for if the ſatisfaction muſt come out of himſelf, he is ſatisfied in himſelf, without any ſatisfaction from the captive.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> God muſt be looked upon as one that dearly loves the captivated elect perſons, who had ſinned againſt him, and would not have them periſh; and withall he muſt be looked upon as one that dearly loved juſtice and truth, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſuffer either of them to be violated; for they are himſelf, as dear to him as himſelf; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he provides that Juſtice and Truth, and the life and welfare of ſuch poor captives, may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt together; and becauſe he ſees it impoſſible by any thing that the electcan do, who had offended, becauſe they are without ſtrength, and can make no ſatisfaction for any treſpaſſe, therefore he himſelf in his wiſdome and love to the Elect, and in his love to Juſtice and Truth, findes out a way to ſave them from ruine, and to ſatisfie theſe. And that is by Chriſt, whom he ſends; and this is all his deſigne, and he lookes for no further gain, nor advantage to himſelf, but that his goodneſſe and righteouſneſſe and truth might be glorified together, in the ſalvation of the Elect,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:48559:159"/> that had ſinned; for what ſtandeth God in need of, and what can be given to him for ſatisfaction, which may be added to his ſtore? If his juſtice and truth in reference to his law be maintained, and kept on foot, with his love to thoſe whom he hath choſen, this is more to him then all the earth and the fulneſſe of it; and other ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he looks for none. The declaration of his juſtice and truth is ſatisfaction enough, and a motive ſtrong enough to let the captive go free, and this he obtained by the intervention of the death and blood of his Son. What advantage had <hi>Zaleucus,</hi> who made a law that adulterers ſhould loſe both their eyes, and he to ſatisfie this law, that he might be accounted juſt and impartiall therein, when his ſon (whom he loved had offended by adultery) cauſed one of his ſons eyes, and another of his own, to be put out, ſave only the praiſe of his juſtice and truth in his lawes? and this is that which God grieves at. And if the Judge, loving the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner that is before him, and knowing he hath nothing to pay, and yet the law recovers pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will give his own ſon to be his ſurety, and will lay the debt upon him, and is content that his ſon ſhall fetch the price out of his own trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, yet the law is ſatisfied, and the judges righteouſneſſe in reference unto it, and his love to the Priſoner are glorified.</p>
               <p>Nor is the ſatisfaction the leſſe, becauſe God
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:48559:159"/> the offended perſon procures it, and not man that offended him; for the truth of God ſtands firme by that means, and the law takes place, and is not made of none effect, as it would have been, had no ſatisfaction been given, which would have redounded to Gods diſhonour; Yea, the righteouſneſſe of God and his love to undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creatures ſhines forth, becauſe the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is of Gods own procuring.</p>
               <p>And though it proceed from God, yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid that God ſatisfies himſelf, or that he was ſatisfied before; for he that provides it, doth not act it, but it is acted in and by an other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The Father ſends the Son, and the Father in the Son receives ſatisfaction; and though the Father and Son be the ſame God, yet they are not the ſame perſon, nor is the ſatisfaction that the Son gives (materially conſidered) given in the divine nature, or God-head, but the Sonne took fleſh, and in that fleſh by dying and ſheding his blood, gave ſatisfaction; ſo that it is from God, but not in God, if we ſpeak of the next and immediate ſubject, which is the man-hood, if the matter of the ſatisfaction be reſpected.</p>
               <p>And though it may be ſaid that God was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied before in reference to his own love to ſuch perſons, he did not repent of it in ſuch ſort as to caſt them off, nor was his purpoſe of glorifying them one whit ſhaken, yet he was not ſatisfied after they had ſinned, and after he had ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:48559:160"/> them to death, in point of righteouſneſſe and truth, to paſſe by their tranſgreſſion without ſatisfaction; his Law was not ſatisfied in a free forgiveneſſe without ſatisfaction, and ſo God was unſatisfied, becauſe the Law was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>It is likewiſe aſſerted, that there is an unſatisfied conſcience in men; men having ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, cannot diſcerne how Gods heart can be towards them without ſatisfaction; therefore the Scripture ſpeaks of propitiation through Chriſts bloud, and of atonement by his death, conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending therein to mans infirmity, which could not otherwiſe apprehend how God could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate life and glory to men after they had ſinned, without being firſt appeaſed and pacified by Chriſts blood: But if things be rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in themſelves, as in truth they are, Chriſt dyed not to reconcile us to God, but to heal us of an evill conſcience, and that we might know that God loved us after we had ſinned, as well as he did before, by the gift of Chriſt, who is the manifeſtation of the Fathers love after the fall which the Elect could not be perſwaded of, but by a pledge of it; Therefore it is ſaid that Chriſt ſhed his bloud to purge our conſcience from dead works, to ſerve the living God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. and not to ſatisfie God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> It will readily be confeſſed, that it was an end of Chriſts dying, to reconcile men to God, and that they might have the anſwer of a good
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:48559:160"/> conſcience before God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. But that this was the ſolitary end, or the principall end, or that ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to God is no end, but is wholly excluded, is denyed, and hath been diſproved all along in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon this ſubject.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What need would there have been that Chriſt ſhould have dyed at all, if only ſatisfaction to mens conſciences concerning Gods goodneſſe and love to fallen creatures had been intended therein. For God could beſt have done that by his ſpirit, and muſt yet do it by his ſpirit, if it be ever done in the hearts of men. Indeed God having given Chriſt, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him up to death, the ſpirit repreſents it as a great manifeſtation of the Fathers love, but the ſpirit might have abundantly aſſured the heart of a ſinner of the Fathers love without it, ſo that there was no neceſſity of Chriſts dying in that regard.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The love of God repreſented unto men in giving Chriſt, is much leſſened to them in the repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if Chriſt were only given to ſatisfie their hearts in reference to their fears of God, &amp; not to ſatisfie Gods juſtice; if there were no need of Chriſt, in reference to any danger they were in, in regard of God, if God could or would have pardoned ſin without him, and his juſtice and truth could have remitted it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is derogatorie to Gods wiſdome and love to aſſert that Chriſt was delivered up to be crucified upon the croſſe, and there to ſhed his blood princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally for this end, to cure mans panique fears and his groundleſſe, cauſeles ſuſpicions of God, and not from any neceſſity that there was in mans evill condition,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:48559:161"/> in regard of ſin committed by him, and of Gods righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe and truth proſecuting it againſt him. For God might have done this in an eaſier way, and have ſpared his dear Son. God is repreſented prodigall of his dear Sons bloud, if he muſt die and bleed out his ſpirits, to cure ſome falſe conceits that men have entertained of God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. What need was there that the Son ſhould come in fleſh, and ſhould empty himſelf of his glory, and that he that is the Lord of glory ſhould be crucified, if no ſatisfaction to divine juſtice was looked at, but only the ſatisfaction of the conſcience? the bloud of God (as it is called) would not have been neceſſary, but the bloud of a meer creature Chriſt, would have ſerved the turne for ſuch a purpoſe, had that been all.</p>
               <p n="5">5. How came thoſe fears in the heart of man after the fall, after ſinne committed? What bred them? was there no ground for them? were they meer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts and jealouſies that wanted a right bottom? did not the threatning before ſinne was committed, cauſe the horrours and terrours that were in the ſoul after ſinne was committed? and if they had Gods threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as the ground of them, <hi>viz. in the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt dye the death,</hi> were they not well grounded? and was it poſſible that theſe fears ſhould be cured by the bloud of Chriſt, and the cauſe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by the bloud of Chriſt, the threatning not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, the truth of God and his righteouſnes not fulfilled and ſatisfied, which were in the threatning and which bred the feares?</p>
               <p n="6">6. Theſe fears and terrors of the Elect, before Chriſts
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:48559:161"/> bloud be brought to their hearts to remove them, are they not of the ſame nature with the horrours of the reprobate in hell? And if ſo, are not both the one and the other that wrath of God which God poures into the ſoul becauſe of ſinne which he proſecutes againſt men? are they not puniſhments for ſin from God? is not Gods righteouſneſſe therein revealed againſt ſin, &amp; the truth of God in the threatning fulfilled, which did reach to both Elect and Reprobate? And if ſo, how can God remove them from the Elect through Chriſt, without ſatisfaction given by Chriſt, and yet ſuffer them to lie upon the Reprobate, without pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable unrighteouſneſſe and untruth, when the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>viz. Thou ſhalt dye the death,</hi> extended to all mankinde in <hi>Adams</hi> loynes without exception?</p>
               <p n="7">7. How may Scripture come to be eluded, and the ſtrength and force of it infringed in all other caſes, if plain pregnant places of it may be evaded after this manner, as when it is ſaid, God hath ſet forth Chriſt to be a propitiation, that is, to be one that appeaſeth God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. and by Chriſt we have received the attonement; <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 11. that is, we have received God attoned to us; for all the offerings in the Law were to attone God to men that had ſinned, if ſuch an anſwer may be taken and may paſſe: <hi>God doth in theſe expreſſions condeſcend to mans infirmity, who thinks God to be angry, and had need to be appeaſed and reconciled;</hi> how eaſie would it be to wreſt and pervert all Scripture? By this that hath been repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, it appears that ſome ſatisfaction to God is neceſſary to be given by Chriſt, and the contrary
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:48559:162"/> doctrine is dangerous and deſperate, and overthrows our juſtification; for if God be not ſatisfied for our ſins, they are not pardoned, and we are yet in our ſins; and this doctrine that thus oppugnes Chriſts ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, doth deny Chriſt to have bought us; for if he payed not any price to God for us, I am ſure he paid none to the divel, nor to any other enemy; for he conquered them by force and power and might, and paid not any price to them; therefore it utterly overthrows Chriſts purchaſe of the Elect; and yet (which is much to be lamented) this doctrine ſpreads very much and corrupts very many.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 2. The ſecond thing that I promiſed to ſpeak to, is this, that ſeeing ſome ſatisfaction muſt be given to God, in reference to a treſpaſſe committed, and an offence taken, and a threatning given out upon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and afterward inflicted upon the perpetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch an evill, what ſatisfaction it is that is neceſſarie: whether any ſatisfaction will ſerve, or whether it muſt be a proportionable ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. It cannot be denyed but that God is the ſoveraigne Lord over all, and hath none above him to appoint him, or to enjoyne him, to give rules and laws to him, how he ought to walk towards the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; none can limit or reſtraine him, or ſet bounds unto him; but his will (which is always holy and juſt and good) is the rule that he acts by; and he doth whatſoever pleaſeth him, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 115. 3. &amp; further then he ſets bounds to himſelf, he cannot be bound up to any thing, or by any one; and further then he reſtrains and limits himſelf, he cannot be reſtrained and limited
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:48559:162"/> by any other. Therefore he might at the firſt (if it had pleaſed him) have pardoned ſin without ſatisfaction; or he might have accounted that for ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which himſelf would accept for ſatisfaction, be it more or leſſe; and ſo the blood of bulls and goats might have ſatisfied as well as the blood of a man, and the blood of a meer man (ſuch as my Antagoniſt would have Chriſt to be) as well as the blood of Chriſt who is God and man; but this comes not home to the point; for we are to conſider what ſatisfaction is now neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, &amp; not what might at firſt have been accepted of.</p>
               <p>2. Satisfaction that will now be admitted of and accepted, is ſatisfaction according to the Law, that holds proportion to it; for the Law is Gods Law, which flowed from Gods righteouſneſſe and holineſſe, and in which, and to which, God hath limited himſelf, and bound up himſelf, ſo that God muſt deny his own Law, and his own Truth, righteouſneſſe and holineſſe that is in it, if he do in the leaſt kind wave that ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that it requires. Now the law to <hi>Adam</hi> (which compriſeth all his poſterity) was, <hi>Thou ſhalt not eat,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for if thou do eat, thou ſhalt ſurely dye; &amp; that ſoul that ſins, ſhall dye; and curſed is every one that continues not in all things written in the Law, to do the ſame.</hi> Therefore the ſatisfaction could not have been leſſe then death, or leſſe then the curſe of the Law, what ever that evil is that is underſtood by death, or by the curſe.</p>
               <p>3. What ever that evill is that reprobated, perſons doe or ſhall endure, upon whom the curſe of the law is laid, and the death threatned, lighteth becauſe they were in <hi>Adams</hi> loynes, when he fell under the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:48559:163"/> of death, and becauſe they continued not in all things written in the Law, and ſo incurred the curſe; I ſay what ever the anguiſh, torture and torment is, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in mind or body, which ſuch perſons paſs, or muſt paſs, abide, or muſtabide under at preſent, or hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the like puniſhment in all degrees, without any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement, have the Elect merited and deſerved, being in the ſame ſtate and condition with the Reprobate, being equally in the loynes of <hi>Adam</hi> with him, and not abiding any more then he did in all things writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Law; and if there be deliverance for the Elect, and the Law in the death and curſe of it be not laid, nor doth light upon them, but ſatisfaction is made in Chriſt for them, then it muſt be a proportionable ſatisfaction that muſt be given to God, in reference to which God doth remit ſuch pains of hell, ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting deſtruction and perdition, and doth releaſe the Elect from them; that is, Chriſt muſt ſuffer the whole, and the full, of that which either any, or all the Elect have deſerved and from which they are acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and diſcharged in Chriſt; Chriſt muſt ſatisfie as far as the guilt of all and every of the Elect extends to, which is as great as the light of the Reprobate, and ſo Chriſts ſufferings in one kind or other, muſt be equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to the eternal damnation of all the Elect, from which they are diſcharged by his ſufferings, equivalent unto thoſe exquiſite torments which the damned in hell do, or ſhal ſuffer, which the Elect had merited as well as they.</p>
               <p>The conſequence of this, is, that Chriſts ſufferings were not the ſufferings of a meer man; for had Chriſt
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:48559:163"/> been but a meer man, his ſufferings for all the Elect could not have been proportionable to their guilt &amp; demerit. For the righteous God (which without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of perſons, had laid all men under the ſame curſe and wrath, becauſe of the ſame ſin and guilt, which without difference, all were under) could not ſave by Chriſt without tranſmitting that curſe and wrath which was due to all and every of the Elect to Chriſt and if Chriſt had been but a meer man, then there would have been need of ſo many Chriſts to have ſuffered and endured as there are Elect perſons; and every one of theſe Chriſts muſt have ſuffered hel, <hi>viz.</hi> the torments of hell as well as death, and then they muſt have ſuffered ever alſo, without any end, and yet could not have juſtified the Elect, becauſe while they ſhould be ſuffering till that be ended, God could not be ſatisfied; and if God could not be ſatisfied, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect could not be juſtified and diſcharged, and ſo to all eternity the Elect could not be acquitted; and this appears in Chriſt, if he had ſuffered and had never got through his ſuffering we had never been ſaved; if he had dyed, and had never riſen, we had never riſen to life and glory.</p>
               <p>And this is that which I preſented, in that Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Inſtance (as he calls it) of mine, <hi>viz. that the ſatisfaction which Chriſt gave to Gods juſtice is deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if Chriſt be but a meer man and not God; for how could the blood of aman ſatisfie for the ſins of many tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſours, whereas there is no proportion betwixt one meer man dying for ſin, and many men ſinning and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving death, each of them for the ſins they have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?</hi>
               </p>

<pb n="329" facs="tcp:48559:164"/> be a truth therein, that it is unconceivable, theſe bare expreſſions (without any addition) might have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with him for an unanſwerable Argument, becauſe he profeſſeth himſelf to be a man ſo given up to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that he will proſtrate himſelf (to uſe his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions) to the ſhadow of it, and his faith will not carry him beyond reaſon, how ſhallow ſoever his apprehenſion is; he will not beleeve further then he can ſee, which hath cauſed him to be ſo unſetled and unſtable in the doctrine of the Trinity, and to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion it ſo long, till at laſt he hath rejected it. 2. That which is unconceivable, and wants the authority of Scripture ſo to countenance it, is not receivable. So did not the doctrine of the Trinity; for though it be an incomprehenſible myſtery, yet it is not an unſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural doctrine, but it is compaſſed about with a cloud of witneſſes, both of the old and new Teſtament, which do declare it with the greateſt clearnes; but that ſuch a thing ſhould be in Chriſts Mediatorſhip, that that which is finite in nature &amp; value, ſhould yet ſatisfie for that which is infinite in provocation and offence, hath neither the light of reaſon, nor the truth of Scripture to draw out conſent unto it, &amp; therfore is worthy to be expunged out of the Saints beliefs. 3. That which is unconceivable &amp; againſt the tenor of the Scripture (which words I added, but he would take no notice therof) deſervs no credit with Chriſtians, but muſt be razed from among the articles of their faith; but that a ſacrifice that is finite in value, ſhould ſatisfie an infinite Juſtice offended, is both incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible by reaſon, and contradictory to Scripture, as
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:48559:165"/> appears from <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 9. <hi>Gifts and Sacrifices while the firſt Tabernacle was ſtanding were offered, which could not make him that did the ſervice perfect:</hi> it could not purge away his ſin nor juſtifie him; what was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it? could not God have taken theſe gifts and ſacrifices for ſatisfaction? no, he could not; the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle faith it could not be; there was no proportion; an offence againſt God muſt be purged away with bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſacrifices then theſe; T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

It is called a greater Tabernacle, becauſe it was not of this building, not framed of the ſeed of male and female<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as other bodies are, but of another building, as the Apoſtle obſerves, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 11. conceived in the wombe of a Virgin, by the over ſhadowing of the Holy Ghoſt; and it was greater alſo, becauſe, not the glory of the Lord filled it only, as it did the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle made in the wilderneſſe, but becauſe the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the Godhead dwelt in him bodily, and by this greater Tabernacle he obtained eternal redemption for us, and entred into heaven to take poſſeſſion of glory for us. Why did not God delight in burnt-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but Chriſt muſt come? the reaſon is rendred, it was to do the Will of God. The Will of God was to have his truth ſatisfied, his law ſatisfied, his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe ſatisfied, that upon juſt, and holy, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable termes he might be reconciled; this was the Will of God. This Will burnt-offerings and ſin-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings could not accompliſh; Chriſt muſt therefore
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:48559:166"/> come to ſatisfie it and to fulfil it. Therefore it is ſaid <hi>Not by the blood of Goats and Calves, but by his own blood he entred once into the holy place,</hi> Heb. 9. 12. and in <hi>ver.</hi> 13, 14. it is ſaid, <hi>If the blood of Buls and Goats do cleanſe the fleſh</hi> (being types of the blood of Chriſt) <hi>how much rather ſhal the blood of Christ clenſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience?</hi> If all had depended upon inſtitution, and that there had been no reſpect had by God of a full ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: the blood of buls and goats, might have been as effectual to have clenſed, not the outſide, but the conſcience, equally as the blood of Chriſt, if the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of clenſing had not depended upon the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the perſon, whoſe blood it was that did clenſe: there would have been no difference betwixt the bloods that did clenſe: therefore the value of the blood in reference to the perſon whoſe it was, fals under the conſideration of God in the buſines of remiſſion.

If the ſuffering of Chriſt had been infinite, there had been no end of it; if the curſe had been infinite, man could not have born it, being uncapable of any thing infinite in the infinity of it.

               <p>He hath been wont to draw up my Arguments into form when he hath apprehended an advantage by it; but at other times pretermits it; I ſhall therfore do it for him at this time; he cals it a Querie, and it runs in that form, but the ſtrength of this Argument is in it.</p>
               <p>If Chriſt be a meer creature, then a ſacrifice finite in value, wil be able to ſatisfie an infinite juſtice offended; but a ſacrifice finite in value, cannot ſatisfie an infinite juſtice offended; <hi>ergo</hi> Chriſt is not a meer crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>He anſwers not to either of theſe propoſitions, nor indeed can do, without running into abſurdities; for firſt the conſequence is firme and good, which will be manifeſt if theſe five things be made out. 1. That the
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:48559:167"/> ſacrifice of a meer creature neither is nor can be any other then finite in value, which none wil doubt of, if they conſider that a meer creature is only finite, and can be nothing more; and if ſo, then the actings of it are according to the nature of it finite alſo, both in their nature, and in their value &amp; worth; for nothing can act beyond it ſelf; and this I beleeve he will not deny. 2. That the juſtice of god is infinite, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is an attribute of God, and is God (for what ever is in God is God) muſt needs be granted, becauſe God himſelf is infinite; and indeed God cannot be compounded of things that are finite; for an infinite being is never made up of finite things, ſo that all in God is infinite. And that which is finite, is limited; and that which is limited, is limited by another which is greater then it, and can limit it; but both theſe are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent to God, who is greater then all, &amp; limits all, but is limited of none. 3. That this infinite juſtice was offended, which is manifeſt, becauſe 1. a juſt and holy law was broken; 2. a righteous and juſt penalty propoſed to warn man leſt he ſhould tranſgreſs, was ſleighted and deſpiſed; 3. man was immediately upon the tranſgreſſion judged and ſentenced with death, and expulſed Paradiſe; 4 becauſe this law was Gods which was tranſgreſſed, and the penalty that was threatned and was deſpiſed, was Gods alſo, therefore the offence in tranſgreſſing and deſpiſing was infinite, though not in the nature of it, yet in relation to ſuch a God who is infinite; which will farther appear, if this be granted, which in reaſon cannot be denied, that faults co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted receive their aggravation as from
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:48559:167"/> the matter and manner of committing, and from the end and deſign, ſo from the object or perſon againſt whom committed; the greater &amp; more excellent the perſon is, againſt whom the tranſgreſſion is, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the tranſgreſſion; therfore if againſt a Prince, it is an high aggravation, and it counted treaſon, and a more grievous death is inflicted; and if it be an high crime againſt him, it is endeavoured that his death may be perpetuated; therefore his torments are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed, and this is judged righteouſneſſe in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that inflict ſuch puniſhment in reference to ſuch tranſgreſſion; and yet the higheſt of men are perſons that muſt die, and their breath is in their noſtrils; and they are not only finite, but their life is like bubbles upon the water, and in compariſon of God they are but as Wormes and Graſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. What then if the fault be againſt God, who is the Prince of all Princes, and before whom the higheſt is but as the duſt of the ballance, who is infinite in his nature and in all his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes; the guilt of ſuch a fault will be according to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, infinite, as the perſon is; and hence it is that it cannot be expiated by perſons that commit a fault againſt God, no not by ſufferings; therefore the wicked and ungodly ſuffer for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, becauſe they can never ſuffer enough, in any time; to give ſatisfaction to God for their tranſgreſſion, therefore they muſt always ſuffer, and there muſt be infinity in their ſuffering, ſo far as they are capable of infinity; we ſay that that which hath no end, is infinite; but the ſufferings of the Reprobate have no end; This comes from the Juſtice of the infinite God, which in puniſhing the creature that ſins againſt him, conſiders the infinite diſtance that is betwixt him and it, and makes the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment proportionable, which made <hi>Eli</hi> ſay to his ſons, <hi>If a man ſinne against a man, the Judge ſhall judge him, but if man ſinne against the Lord, who ſhall intreat for him?</hi> the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is ſuch that there is no mediatour that the creature can find out for him, but he is puniſhed with everlaſting deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:48559:168"/> from the preſence of the Lord. 4. That ſacrifice is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that was ordained of God to ſatisfie the juſtice of God, which muſt needs be confeſſed, if it can be proved that God was attoned, appeaſed, pacified by ſacrifice, and that tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions againſt God, which carry infinite guilt in them are remitted by them; but this is manifeſt from many places of Scripture, <hi>Lev.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>and chap.</hi> 4. 26, 31, 34. and divers others. 5. The ſacrifice that Chriſt offered to God, when he offered himſelf to God, was ſufficient to ſatisfie Gods juſtice, though infinitely wronged, and offended by the Elects tranſgreſſions, <hi>Rom</hi> 8. 33, 34. <hi>Who can lay any thing to the charge of Gods E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect? it is God that juſtifieth;</hi> but how can that be when ſo juſt and ſo holy a law hath been tranſgreſſed, and the juſtice of God calling upon God for ſatisfaction? The Apoſtle anſwers it in the next words, <hi>Who can condemne? it is Chriſt that died, or rather that is riſen again.</hi> This imports that Chriſt by dying hath given ſuch ſatisfaction that nothing can condemne; the Law that was tranſgreſſed cannot, Gods juſtice cannot, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 26. <hi>Christ hath once in the end of the world appeared to put away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf,</hi> and ver. 12. <hi>Chriſt by his own blood entred once into the holy place, having obtained eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal redemption for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The minor Propoſition or the Aſſumption is undeniable, and needs no proof, which is this; <hi>A ſacrifice finite in value, cannot ſatisfie an infinite juſtice offended;</hi> for there muſt be ſome proportion betwixt the offence by which infinite juſtice is ingaged againſt perſons that commit it, and the ſatisfaction that is tendred and given to juſtice ſo ingaged, in reference to tranſgreſſion; but what proportion betwixt a finite ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a finite value and vertue, and infinite juſtice moved, ſtirred, offended, and ingaged againſt men?</p>
               <p>Now unto this Argument there is no anſwer returned, but ſome little arguing there is againſt an infinite ſacrifice, which is rather a denying of the concluſion, then an anſwering to any premiſe of the Argument. Notwithſtanding it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that I conſider what he objecteth againſt the thing which I drive at, though he comes not near the Argument, which I propounded to arrive at it.</p>

               <p> 
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> How doth that appear in my expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when I onely ask a queſtion how a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice finite in value, can ſatisfie an infinite Juſtice offended? And in ſteed of anſwering it, there is deep ſilence, he paſſeth it over as if he had not obſerved it.</p>
               <p>Yet he ſaith, <hi>The Scripture tels us that Chriſt was made ſin, or a ſin-offering for us, by taking our ſins, and bearing the Curſe: but how this Sacrifice was infinite, to me is unconceivable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> And doth not the Scripture tell us, that the perſon that was made this ſin-offering was God? therefore his bloud is called <hi>the bloud of God,</hi> Acts 20. 28. was the Lord of glory; therefore it is ſaid, <hi>had they known him, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory:</hi> now this is the Title of the moſt high God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24. 7. Pſal. 29. 3. Was the great Shepherd of the ſheep; yea the chief Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd; which is equivalent to the moſt high God: for the moſt high is familiarly in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture called a Shepherd. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23. 1, and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80. 1. And if ſo, then he is chief Shepherd; and if chief Shepherd, then Chriſt is he, becauſe there are not two chief Shepherds, but one chief Shepherd; and ſo the Father and Chriſt are one and the ſame chief Shepherd. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 20. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 4. The great or chief Shepherd is ſaid to be brought again from the dead by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: ſo that the perſon that was this ſin-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:48559:169"/> was as great, as high, as excellent, as can be imagined; as high as the higheſt, infinitely high and great, as theſe Scriptures do declare; for ſuch a perſon according to the fleſh that he aſſumed, was crucified, did ſhed his bloud, was raiſed again by the Father, in ſome places of Scripture, by himſelf in other; for the Father and he work the ſame works; the Father raiſeth the dead, yea the dead body of Chriſt; and the Son raiſeth the dead, and his own dead body alſo; as hath been ſhewed before.</p>
               <p>Yea further, Doth not the Scripture tell us, that Chriſt through the eternal Spirit offered up himſelf without ſpot to God, and that his blood in this regard is made more effectual for the purging away of ſin, than the bloud of Bulls and Goats? <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. <hi>How much more</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>ſhall the bloud of Chriſt, who through the eternal Spirit offered up himſelf to God, purge your Conſciences from dead works to ſerve the living God?</hi> In this Scripture here is both the Sacrifice and the Prieſt that offered it. Chriſt according to his Humanity is the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; it was himſelf according to the Fleſh that was offered up: and Chriſt according to his Divinity or Deity was the Prieſt that offered up him according to the Fleſh. It is ſaid that Chriſt did it through the Eternal Spirit; What is this Eternal Spirit? It was not the ſoul of Chriſt; for firſt, The ſoul of Chriſt is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:48559:169"/> eternal, no more then he will grant the ſufferings of the creature in hell to be infinite; and yet they never ſhall have end: that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly eternal which neither hath beginning nor ending, and ſo cannot be meaſured: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nothing can be ſaid to be paſt, and nothing future and to come, in that which is eternal; and eternity is one of the Attributes of the moſt high God, and incommunicable to the creature; though ſomtimes that which hath no end is ſaid (but very improperly) to be eternal.</p>
               <p>2. The ſoul of Chriſt may be ſaid to be a part of the ſacrifice that Chriſt offered up to God by or through the eternal Spirit; for though he ſuffered in the fleſh, and ſhed his bloud according to the fleſh, yet he ſuffered in the ſoul, bore the wrath of God in the ſoul, and the curſe of ſin lay upon the ſoul as well as upon the body; therefore the ſoul as well as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was in a ſenſe offered up to God; and therefore both of them are diſtinct from the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſpirit that is here ſpoken of, by which it is ſaid he offered up himſelf; that which was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and that by which it was offered, are different things from one another. 3. When Chriſt ſpeaks of his ſoul, he calls it Spirit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out adding the Epithite of Eternal to it. <hi>Luke</hi> 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 46. 4. The ſouls of men may be as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and truly called eternal Spirits, as the ſoul of Chriſt be called an eternal Spirit, being of the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:48559:170"/> ſame nature both the one and the other: But where is ſuch an Adjective added to them in Scripture, as Eternal?</p>
               <p>Nor can the Spirit of God be meant by this eternal ſpirit; for Chriſt in reference to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſpirit, is made the Prieſt and the Efficient that offered up to God that which was offered up, <hi>viz.</hi> the whole Humane Nature of Chriſt conſiſting of ſoul and body; though Scripture ſpeak moſt of the body in which he dyed and ſhed his bloud. For this Pronoun <hi>who,</hi> points at ſomthing in Chriſt beſides ſoul and body which was offered to God; which did ſlay the ſacrifice, and offer it up: and this can be nothing but the eternal ſpirit in Chriſt, the Deity of Chriſt, by which ſpirit he went and preached to the ſpirits in priſon in the days of <hi>Noah,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had either ſoul or body; and by which ſpirit he ſearcheth the heart, which the ſoul of Chriſt cannot do: and the ſpirit of God it was not, becauſe Chriſt is ſpoken of in thoſe places, and not the holy Ghoſt. Nor can it be ſaid that he offered up himſelf by another ſpirit that was not his, but by his own ſpirit; as it is ſaid, that he entred into heaven not by other bloud which was not his, but by his own bloud, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 12. Beſides, this offering up of himſelf through the eternal ſpirit, is that that is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to put the value upon the offering up of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to God, above all the legal Sacrifices; for
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:48559:170"/> otherwiſe, the bloud of a man is no more to God than the bloud of a beaſt: but the perſon in reference to this eternal ſpirit, is more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and glorious than all other creatures either men or beaſts; in which regard his fleſh is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a greater and more perfect Tabernacle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this eternal ſpirit dwelt in it, and filled it with glory. By the bloud of this perſon he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.</p>
               <p>And this is the formal reaſon and cauſe whence it came to paſs that the ſufferings of Chriſt, which both in ſoul and body were finite and received an end, for he ſuffered once, and doth not alwaies ſuffer; yet are able to expiate ſins which carry infinite guilt in them, being againſt an infinite God; and are able to free millions of perſons from ſufferings; which are as it were eternal and infinite, becauſe they would not have any end, if Chriſt by ſuffering had not diſcharged from them; for otherwiſe it would be utterly impoſſible that by one ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice or offering he ſhould for ever perfect them that are ſanctified, but it would have been as when the high Prieſt offered up daily the ſame ſacrifices, becauſe ſin could not be taken away by one ſacrifice: but it is this eternal ſpirit that doth put the worth, and value, and merit into this one ſacrifice: therefore it is ſaid that every Prieſt ſtandeth daily miniſtring and offering up
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:48559:171"/> the ſame ſacrifices, which can never take away ſin; But this man after he had offered one ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for ſins, for ever ſate down on the right hand of God, expecting from henceforth till his enemies be made his foot-ſtool: <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 11, 12, 13. As one that hath done a work that hath great merit, deſert, and worth in it expects a reward, looks that things ſhould be ſo and ſo done to him; ſo Chriſt after he had offered one ſacrifice, ſate down, expecting the enemies to be ſubdued at his feet: which had the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been of himſelf a meer man, he could not have done; for what is man that he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve any thing of God?</p>
               <p>Now becauſe the word merit doth reliſh ill in reference to Chriſt himſelf with many, and becauſe all ſuch who are againſt ſatisfaction by Chriſt, or at leaſt againſt full ſatisfaction, are much more againſt merit, becauſe there is no ſuch word found in Scripture, therefore I ſhall clear up the Doctrine of Chriſts merit from the Scripture.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Scripture teſtifies that Chriſt hath made a purchaſe; <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. <hi>Feed the flock of God which he hath purchaſed with his own bloud:</hi> this is ſpoken of Chriſt, who is called God; and he is ſaid to purchaſe the Church with his bloud. The Church is called a purchaſed poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 14. The Jews were called a people peculiar by purchaſe; ſo in the Original:
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:48559:171"/> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. Salvation is ſaid to be obtained by purchaſe through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 9. ſo it is in the Greek. Now this purchaſe is not an acquiſition of grace, as ſome may conceive, who may give this ſenſe of it: Chriſt hath gained the Church, and gained or obtained ſalvation; but through grace he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and gained; which in an analogical ſenſe may be called a purchaſe: but this purchaſe is an acquiſition of work, as the Greek word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies that is uſed by the holy Ghoſt, which is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which ſignifies to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, and get by work; which is uſed in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>They that have uſed the Office of a Deacon well, purchaſe to themſelves a good degree.</hi> Now he that purchaſeth any thing, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the thing that he purchaſeth; but Chriſt hath purchaſed the Church, hath purchaſed ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, hath performed a work that deſerves the having of the Church, and the having of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Church; ſo that if words might not be formally ſtood upon too much, it is manifeſt that we have the thing in equivalent expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Merit and Deſert properly have reſpect to ſome work which is not due, neither could be required from ſuch a perſon; in which ſenſe Chriſt may be ſaid to merit, when yet the perſons on whoſe behalf Chriſt hath done ſuch a work, could not have been ſaid to have merited, if they
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:48559:172"/> in their own perſons had done it; the reaſon is, becauſe if men having ſinned againſt God, had been able to ſatisfie the Law to the utmoſt, in reference to their ſin they had committed againſt it, and had done it, yet they could have merited nothing from God, becauſe ſuch ſatisfaction was due from them who had ſo offended, and it would be but the paying of a juſt debt; but if an innocent one will come in for another, and this not only out of his reſpect to the delinquent or offending perſon, but alſo to accompliſh the will of the offended perſon, this is not debt, this could not be required; there is not any Law that requires an innocent one to ſuffer; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here is deſert and merit. Now this is the caſe in reference to Chriſts ſufferings, they are ſufferings of a juſt one for unjuſt ones, as the Scripture teſtifies, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. therefore there is deſert and merit in it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a Covenant entred into betwixt God and Chriſt voluntarily on both ſides, in which ſomthing is required and condeſcended to upon condition; in which reſpect it may be ſaid, that Chriſt having done the works requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, deſerves the accompliſhment of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion agreed on; as <hi>Jacob</hi> having ſerved for a wife, might ſay, Give me the wife which I have ſerved for: which yet cannot be aſſerted in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the Covenant of God with <hi>Adam;</hi> for though it was of works, yet thoſe works
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:48559:172"/> might have been required without covenant, and conſequently without condition; and ſo it was of grace that there was either the one or the other, either covenant or condition; but works might have been required without any intimation of reward. But Chriſt is a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent perſon then <hi>Adam;</hi> he is the Lord from heaven; a Son, and not a ſervant, and did vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily empty himſelf, and humble himſelf, and come in the form of a ſervant; <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 7. therefore God highly exalted him in our fleſh, and us in him, and it was compact and covenant, as appears from <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>God which cannot ly, promiſed eternal life before the world was.</hi> To whom was this promiſe of God made, while as yet the world was not made? To no creature, becauſe there was no creature; it was made to Chriſt, it was the Fathers promiſe to the Son, it reſpected a work to be done by Chriſt, to which work the Father made a promiſe; the work was the Redemption of Elect in a way of ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to juſtice, becauſe of tranſgreſſion; and the promiſe was of eternal life to the Elect ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 6. <hi>Chap.</hi> 49. 8.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There was ſomthing performed by Chriſt for the ſatisfaction of God, which was ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abundant to the tranſgreſſion of all the Elect, in reference to the dignity and excellency of the Perſon that performed it, which was not a meer man, as hath been abundantly proved, but God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:48559:173"/> for as there is no proportion betwixt God offended and man ſatisfying, ſo there is no proportion betwixt man ſinning, and God ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying for ſuch ſin; and as in ſome ſenſe a meaner ſuffering for ſin would have been ſo far from meriting, that he could not have ſatisfied, ſo in a ſenſe it may be ſaid, that ſuch a perſon as Chriſt is ſuffering, not onely ſatisfyed, but me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited in ſatisfying; for this one ſacrifice of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> offering up himſelf to God in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, efficacy, value, and force of it, might have extended to have purged away the ſins of millions more tranſgreſſors, if God had pleaſed, and if they had belonged to the Election of Grace.</p>
               <p n="5">5. God had ſatisfaction which was full and compleat, and perfect in Chriſt, and which was given at once for the ſins of all the Elect, which without Chriſt could not have been had no not by the ſufferings of the perſons that had ſinned, though God ſhould have laid upon them as much puniſhment as they could be able to bear; yet becauſe the guilt is infinite, and the creature finite, the creature might have been ever ſuffering and never ſatisfying: Now it is an advantage to the Creditor to receive full payment, and to have it at once; and it is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage to receive it in parcels, and never to receive all. But tranſgreſſors, if the debt ly upon them, will be ever paying, but never all paid;
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:48559:173"/> will be ever ſuffering, but never ſatisfying by what is ſuffered, but ſtill God is a loſer when ever the account is caſt up: But in Chriſts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, becauſe he paid God all, therefore God hath advantage by Chriſts interpoſition and ſuretyſhip which Chriſt hath undergone, in which reſpect it may be ſaid that Chriſt hath merited and deſerved.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The death of Chriſt is not only of vertue and of value for the redemption of tranſgreſſors from death and deſtruction in a way of ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but it alſo obtains an eternal inheritance for ſuch perſons who are ſo redeemed; and this comes from the ſuper-abundance of worth and value in Chriſts death; that after ſatisfaction even to God by it, there remains yet ſomthing of vertue and efficacy in it, to deſerve ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther favor and grace for tranſgreſſors, then bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to free them and deliver them; <hi>viz.</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and obtain for them eternal inheritance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15. and all this comes to paſs from the tranſcendent glory and majeſty of the perſon who dyed and roſe again; Chriſt through the eternal Spirit offered himſelf to God, and ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected not only eternal Redemption, but eternal Inheritance for us, becauſe his Sacrifice who thus offered himſelf, was infinite in value.</p>
               <p>But he argues againſt an infinite ſacrifice thus,</p>
               <p>If the ſufferings of Chriſt had been infinite, there had been no end of them.</p>
               <pb n="348" facs="tcp:48559:174"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> The ſufferings of Chriſt were not infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, materially conſidered, neither in the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of them, nor in the duration and continuance of them; but in reference to the ſubject perſon who underwent them, who was God manifeſt in fleſh; The Word made fleſh, who dwelt among us, and was put to death among us, and in ſuffering offered a ſacrifice in value in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite.</p>
               <p>He further ſaith,</p>
               <p>If the Curſe had been infinite, man could not have born it, being uncapable of any thing infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in the infinity of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> It is true that man cannot bear it, as not being capable to bear any thing that is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, therefore he is ever bearing as he is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and yet muſt ever bear without an end; becauſe he cannot bear it at once; and ſo it comes to paſs that he ſuffers that which is in ſome ſenſe infinite; not in the greatneſs, but in the continuance; that, which though it be not beyond meaſure, yet is beyond end. But Chriſt being not onely great in ſtrength, but greater in worth, ſuffered that which as from him had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite worth in it.</p>
               <p>He thus concludes,</p>
               <p>It is enough for me to believe that my Lord Jeſus ſuffered for me whatever I deſerved to ſuffer; and was the curſe of the Law, be that what it will.</p>
               <pb n="349" facs="tcp:48559:174"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> It is a fearful thing to conſider both of the blindneſs and preſumptuouſneſs of men, that even they which deny Chriſt, and in ſome ſenſe deſpitefully uſe him, will yet lay claim to him; but let all ſuch know, that he that denyeth the Son, denyeth the Father alſo; and ſuch with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance can have no mercy.</p>
               <p>As for that general knowledge which he comforts himſelf in, it is a ſeeing a far off, and is next to blindneſs; it is like the light of him that ſaw men like trees walking, there's more darkneſs in it than light. The myſterie of Chriſt is not ſeen in it; it warms not, heats not, quickens not the heart in love, nor by it are perſons able to know what it is they ſtumble at. It is the knowledge of thoſe that care not what they know; who behold that which appears above ground, but wil not dig for knowledge as for ſilver: Such who reſt themſelves contented with ſuch a knowledge, are never like to know that love of Chriſt that paſſeth knowledge. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 10.</p>
               <p>This is but ſutable to ſome other expreſſions of his concerning the perſon of Chriſt; to know Chriſt to be a perſon ſent of God, hath been declared to be ſufficient knowledge to ſave men; and that text alſo in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 9. is made uſe of, and this concluſion exſerted from it, that to know Chriſt to be the Lord, whether created or uncreated, whether the ſame with the Father,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:48559:175"/> or made by the Father, is not material; a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may be ſaved without it.</p>
               <p>But ſuch aſſertions are detrimental to god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, ſerve to nouriſh up ignorance of God and Chriſt, and the myſterie of the Goſpel in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal perſons, who have been wont to ſay, what need is there of ſo much knowledge? to know my ſelf a ſinner, and that Chriſt dyed for me, is enough; and Chriſt rebukes it, and makes the Scribes and Phariſces aſhamed of it, when he asks them whoſe ſon Chriſt was; and when they ſaid <hi>David</hi>'s; he demands how it could be, when <hi>David</hi> in ſpirit called him Lord? but they were confounded and were not able to anſwer him. Their general know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that Chriſt was <hi>David</hi>'s ſon, without a right perception of his Divinity, in which reſpect he was <hi>David</hi>'s Lord, was no better then ſhameful ignorance, (ſeeing God had revealed both the one and the other) both in them and us.</p>
               <p>In the cloſe of his anſwer he deals with a Scripture which I produced to prove that the ſatisfaction and merit that was in Chriſts bloud, was from the ſubject perſon whoſe bloud it was; it is called <hi>the bloud of God, Acts</hi> 20. 28. And indeed he deals injuriouſly with it, and evilly intreats it. His words are theſe.</p>
               <p>I ſhall offer theſe few things to conſideration.</p>
               <pb n="351" facs="tcp:48559:175"/>
               <p> There may be ſome miſtake in it, God may be put for Chriſt or Lord, and then the words muſt be thus read; <hi>to feed the Church of Chriſt which he hath purchaſed with his own bloud.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And why may there be a miſtake? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (ſaith he) the Churches of the Saints are called the Churches of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 16. and there is poſſibility, probability, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility to countenance it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> 1. Logicians have been wont to ſay, <hi>a poſſe ad eſſe non valet conſequentia:</hi> that the deduction, inference, or conſequence that is drawn from [a may be] to [a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo] is weak, and very invalid. There may be a miſtake (ſaith he) and muſt there therefore be a miſtake ſay I? What good conſequence can be in this? 2. This Doctrine of miſtakes in Scripture, eſpecially in points of ſuch grand concernment, is dangerous to be broached; it tends greatly to engender Atheiſme in the hearts of men, and ſerves to no better a purpoſe then to unſettle men in the Faith; for what will be the conſequent of it, if there be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes in ſome things contained in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, why not in other things? and then what will remain firm that may be ſurely built upon? And may not any Heretick when he
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:48559:176"/> is driven out, and forced to forſake all other holds, fly hither, and ſhelter himſelf here, there may be a miſtake in the Text or Texts that are cited? 3. If there were no other place of Scripture wherein Chriſt were called God, and if there were no place that holds analogy with this of the <hi>Acts,</hi> where the bloud of Chriſt is called the bloud of God, there might then be better plea for a miſtake, which yet would be of evil conſequence if it were granted; but there is a cloud of witneſſes that come in to evidence Chriſts God-head, and there are parallel places to this Text that ſpeaks of the bloud of God: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>Had they known him, they would never have crucified the Lord of Glory.</hi> Chriſt was crucified as he was man, and ſhed his bloud as he was man, and he was not crucified as he was the Lord of Glory, nor did he ſhed his bloud as he was God; and yet it is ſaid, the Lord of Glory was crucified, and the bloud of God was ſhed: The meaning is, the Perſon who was Lord of Glory, and who was God, was crucified, and ſhed his bloud; but not as he was Lord of Glory, nor as he was God, but fleſh was aſſumed, the humanity was taken, and in that nature he was crucified, and ſhed his bloud.</p>
               <p>But let it be weighed what he ſaith of the poſſibility. The Scribe (ſaith he) through care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs, or ſomthing worſe, might here put God
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:48559:176"/> for Chriſt. There are two places, one in the old Teſtament, another in the new, which <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let</hi> conceiveth to have been miſtaken by the Scribes negligence, or ſomthing worſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> What Scribe doth he here ſpeak of who might be thus negligent, or ſomthing worſe? Doth he mean ſuch Scribes as the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men of God, who were inſpired by the holy Ghoſt, made uſe of to write what was ſuggeſted and dictated to them by the Spirit? Then thoſe holy Men, Prophets, or Apoſtles, whether ever they were, who no queſtion had the ſuperviſing and peruſing of it after written, would have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered it, and corrected it. Doth he ſpeak of any other Scribes who might afterwards write out Copies of ſuch things? The Original wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting would have been extant to have detected and confuted ſuch miſtakes, and fraud, and falſhood, and there would have been godly ones enough in thoſe Ages, to have rectified out of the Original ſuch error or deceit. Can any Printer now by any craft or cunning bring cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption into any Text of Scripture but it would ſoon be diſcerned? Nor could any Scribe then,</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>This Lection</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of</hi> CAARI, as a Lyon, <hi>the latter Jews have ſnatched at, leſt they ſhould be forced to confeſs that this Prophecie,</hi> [They pierced my hands and my feet] <hi>was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in none other but in Jeſus Christ alone; becauſe neither</hi> David <hi>(who compiled this Pſalm) nor any other had their hands and their feet pierced.</hi> But <hi>Joannes Iſaacus</hi> hath moſt learnedly ſhewed in his defence of the Hebrew verity againſt <hi>Lindanus,</hi> that nothing is more abſurd and fooliſh then ſuch a Lection or Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 1. Becauſe it is pointed contrary to the Rules of Grammer if the ſignification ſhould be <hi>[as a Lyon]</hi> 2. Becauſe the expreſſion would be maimed, and defective, and without ſenſe; for what reaſon is in theſe words <hi>[as a Lyon my hands and my feet?</hi> 3. He produceth the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority both of <hi>Maſſoreth</hi> the great, and the leſs.

               <p>And <hi>Rivet</hi> adds this, that in all the Hebrew Copies or Exemplars, there is both CAARI and CARU, the one in margent, and the other in the Text: Not that CAARI whether in the margent or in the Text is to be read <hi>[as a Lyon]</hi> but it is <hi>vox animala,</hi> a word beſide rule, and is the third perſon of the preterperfect tenſe CARA, by ſome interpoſition and change of letters, as is ſomtimes found in the Hebrew; And he giveth inſtances of the like.</p>

And they are never a whit the leſs the Churches of God, becauſe they be the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Chriſt; yea becauſe they be the Churches of Chriſt, they be therefore the Churches of God; and this Text proves it: For Chriſt is the perſon that is here ſpoken of, becauſe the perſon that ſhed his bloud for the purchaſe of the Church is ſpoken of, which is Chriſt, and he is called God, and as God, the Church is his; as the words declare, which he hath not yet overthrown.</p>
               <p>But he attempts it by an other conſideration which he offers to view:</p>
               <p>2. <hi>If it proves that there is no miſtake in the Text</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there may be a defect in the words; for the laſt clauſe ſome Greek Copies have it thus; which he hath purchaſed with the bloud of his Own, and ſo the Word</hi> SON <hi>is to be underſtood; with the bloud of his own Son.</hi>

                  <hi>Repl.</hi> It is ſaid of ſome perſons who are loth to work, that they live by their ſhifts, or by their wits; ſo this man, who is loth to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the Truth, will maintain and keep alive an errour (if he can) by his wits, or by his ſhifts, which are more than one; and when one
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:48559:179"/> fails him, he flies to an other; yet all that he ſays is but <hi>[may be]</hi> which we have been troubled enough with already: He doth not ſay there is a defect in the words, but <hi>it may be there is,</hi> which we know proves nothing. Yet I ſhall paſs over his <hi>[may be]</hi> in ſilence, but ſay ſomthing to that which he bottoms it upon; he ſaith, <hi>Some Greek Copies read it thus, which he hath purchaſed with the bloud of his own,</hi> meaning <hi>[Son:]</hi> but <hi>Beza</hi> ſaith it is one Copie that the words run ſo in; whether ſhall I believe (for I have not ſeen all the Greek Copies my ſelf, though I have examined ſome) <hi>Beza</hi> or him? When he comes up to <hi>Beza</hi>'s learning and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, I ſhall be at a ſtand whoſe teſtimony to take, but not till then. However this will do him no good; for the bloud is the price where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the purchaſe was made; and it was his bloud that made it, for it was not made with an others bloud; but the Text is cleer, and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not overthrow it, that the perſon that purchaſed it is God; then the bloud muſt needs be the bloud of God alſo, becauſe therewith he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed: So that if there be one Copie that ſaith <hi>which he purchaſed with the bloud of his own,</hi> yet the defect will be in the word <hi>ſelf</hi> that is wanting, and not in the word <hi>Son</hi> that is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the words muſt run thus; <hi>which he purchaſed with the bloud of his own ſelf.</hi> And if it were as he would have it, <hi>with the bloud of</hi>

                  <hi>his own Son,</hi> yet it is a proper Son that is ſpoken of; and the Apoſtle makes him God in that expreſſion: As the Jews ſaid of Chriſt, that <hi>he made himſelf equal with God,</hi> becauſe he ſaid, <hi>God was his own proper Father,</hi> as the words are in the Original, <hi>John</hi> 5. 18. and this amounts to as much as I intended in the quotation of the place; this puts value and merit enough upon the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, that it was the bloud of a perſon that was God and equal with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that was ſhed for the taking away of ſin.</p>
               <p>But he hath a third evaſion, and if he be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten out from the covert of that, whither will he then fly?</p>
               <p>3. <hi>If both theſe be removed,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>yet the words may have an other meaning then what you and many others do allot them; Chriſts bloud may be ſaid to be Gods own bloud in way of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, it being more excellent by far then the bloud of the Legal Sacrifices. In the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, tall Trees are called the Cedars of God; in this ſenſe alſo Chriſt is called the Lamb of God,</hi> John 1. 36. <hi>becauſe he was far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent then either the paſchal Lamb, or any other Lamb which was to be ſlain in way of Sacrifice: And the Author to the Hebrews in this ſenſe prefers the bloud of Chriſt far before all other bloud ſhed for the expiation of ſin,</hi> Heb. 9. 13, 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> If he could but turn the word <hi>[may]</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the word <hi>[muſt]</hi> and could be able to make
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:48559:180"/> it out from the text or context, that the ſenſe that he puts upon the words muſt be the true ſenſe of the place, and that none other that any other allots to it can ſtand or conſiſt with it, there would be ſome weight in his words; but this <hi>[may be]</hi> hath nothing but weakneſs and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in it.</p>
               <p>2. The ſenſe that he puts upon the text, is without ſenſe, there is not the leaſt footing for it in the Text; it is a meer invention, without the ſhadow of reaſon in it, for that which it is grounded on, is not to be found in the Text; there is no mention of the bloud of God in the Text, and therefore no reaſon he ſhould paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel it with ſuch like phraſes as the Trees of God, the Cedars of God, which are of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with other trees, but are more excellent, and are therefore called the Trees and Cedars of God. The words in the Greek are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which <hi>Beza</hi> renders <hi>ſuo illo proprio ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine,</hi> that is, by that his own proper bloud; and it relates to the ſubject ſpoken of before, which is God; for the exhortation is, <hi>to ſeed the Church of God,</hi> and it is added, <hi>which he,</hi> that is, which God <hi>hath purchaſed with his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per bloud;</hi> ſo that it is the bloud of God through the relation it hath to a perſon, that is called God, whoſe bloud it is, and not by way of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, as trees are called the trees of God, for the excellency they have in them above other
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:48559:181"/> trees, which yet ſtand in no relation to God, Now if he be able to prove that God is not here ſpoken of, but it is another that is not God, though he be called God; then may he prove that the bloud that is ſaid to be his bloud, is yet not the bloud of the perſon that is God, but the bloud of anothet that is called God, but is not God; otherwiſe it ſtands in force: the bloud of Chriſt is not the bloud of a meer creature, but the bloud of God; whence the merit of it proceeds for the expiating of ſin.</p>
               <p>Whereas he ſaith that in this ſenſe <hi>Chriſt is called the Lamb of God, becauſe he was far more excellent then the Paſchal Lamb, oa any other Lamb that was ſacrificed.</hi> It is granted that he was ſo called for that reaſon, and not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt who was ſlain was man, and thoſe Lambs were bur bruit creatures, and ſo inferior to him, but becauſe the perſon of this Lamb ſlain, was more then a man, was the Son of God, and very God; but not ſlain like a Lamb as he was the Son of God, and very God, but according to the humanity which he aſſumed; and as the ſon of man, and very man, ſo was he ſlain. It is ſaid <hi>the ſon of man muſt be delivered up into the hands of men, and they ſhall kill him:</hi> yet though he could not ſuffer as God, he not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding by the eternal Spirit, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Divinity or God-head, offered up himſelf a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice a Lamb without ſpot and blemiſh to
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:48559:181"/> God; which made his bloud more effectual to expiate ſin, then the blood of Goats could be; for otherwiſe there would have been no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in point of worth and value, in purging away of ſins of men; for the bloud of a man at the moſt, could but ſatisfie for the offence of a man, and not of many men; and to this purpoſe the bloud of a man would have been as ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual as the bloud of a beaſt.</p>
               <p>I have been large in the vindication of this inſtance, becauſe the matter of it was weighty, it being a great Truth of God, and of high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to the Saints: I ſhall be the briefer in the next.</p>
               <p>The ninth Argument or Inſtance that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, was this.</p>

His expreſſions did run thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We have already been troubled enough with the Prophet I ſay:</hi> Wherein he firſt breaks his reſt upon me. 2. He doth it in a profane way, abuſing that Evangelical Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> which abbreviated is written <hi>Iſay,</hi> whoſe perſon and name deſerve reverence, becauſe the honour of becoming the Pen-man of the holy Ghoſt was put upon him. Nor was there occaſion given him to ſport thus with the Prophets name, for I know not that any ſuch words can be found in my writing, as [I ſay] no nor yet the ſenſe of them; for I have not nakedly delivered any thing but there hath been either Scripture or
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:48559:182"/> Argument to inforce it; and in this very inſtance, <hi>viz. If Chriſt be a meer creature, then the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Chriſt is overthrown;</hi> there is a reaſon to inforce it, which was thus; <hi>Becauſe a meer man being in heaven, could not know the ſtate of the Churches in all places upon earth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not intercede according to the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and neceſſity of the Churches:</hi> And though this reaſon was not confirmed with another, (which it ſeems he expected it ſhould have bin) yet it was not becauſe there was no good reaſon to be rendred, but becauſe I was in great ſtraits of time when I thought of, and wrote out that paper of Scripture and Arguments, and had not liberty to enlarge upon any thing, having not three hours to conſider of the thing; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I intended them to fall under the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of more candid perſons; and becauſe I thought what I preſented, might eaſily be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from Scripture, if there ſhould be any conteſt.</p>
               <p>Nor hath he invalidated the proof I brought for the ſtrengthning of this Argument, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his complaint of want of proof. Let it be conſidered what he ſaith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>have you learned to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the knowledge of him who hath received the ſpirit without meaſure? Cannot he as man know in heaven what things are done on earth? Who told you ſo?</hi>

               <p> 
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> Theſe are ſtrange expreſſions to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from one that denyes the Deity of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit equally, as he doth the Deity of Chriſt; and who makes both the Son, and the holy Ghoſt finite creatures; and who makes the Son the firſt and principall of all the creatures, and the Lord of all the reſt, yea God (in ſome ſence) to them all; and ſo the ſpirit himſelf is ſervant unto Chriſt, and Chriſt is his Lord, and in a kind his God.</p>
               <p>The conradictions in this expoſtulation of his, <hi>What? have you learned to meaſure the knowledge of him who hath received the ſpirit without meaſure?</hi> in reference to the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Tenents of his, are not a few.</p>
               <p>His expreſſions ſeem to me to carry ſuch a ſenſe; 1. That Chriſts knowledge is ſo great that it is unmeaſurable, and conſequently infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite; and yet he himſelf but a creature; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently finite, which is a contradiction. 2. That this knowledge of Chriſt came to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurable, becauſe the ſpirit was given to him without meaſure, and yet the ſpirit himſelf is finite, and conſequently meaſurable according to him. And if the ſpirit were infinite, and his wiſdom infinite, (as indeed he is though he denye it) yet if Chriſt be a meer creature and wholely finite, as he holds, the maxime is infallible, that, <hi>quicquid recipitur, recipitur ad modum recipientis; What ever thing is received</hi>
                  <pb n="367" facs="tcp:48559:183"/> 
                  <hi>is received according to the Capacity of that which doth receive it;</hi> and conſequently, when Chriſt who receives the Spirit is finite, he is not capable to receive any proportion of the ſpirit but what is finite, and be may meaſured; though the ſpirit were infinite. And ſo there is a double con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. 3. That this excellent knowledge of Chriſt, which he ſaith cannot be meaſured, was received by his receiving of the ſpirit; and yet Chriſt is greater, and more excellent then this ſpirit, and the Creator of him, and Lord and God unto him, which is an other contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>Obj.</p>
               <p>But he may plead for himſelf, and lay, that his words are wreſted; and that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of me, whether I have learned to meaſure the knowledge of him, <hi>&amp;c?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Though I am not able to meaſure the knowledge of Chriſt (who received the Spirit) poſitively, ſo as to declare exactly what meaſure he received, and no more; yet I am able to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the knowledge of Chriſt (which he had by the donation of the Spirit) negatively; I can ſay it was not unmeaſurable, it was not infinite.</p>
               <p>But he bottoms this interrogation upon a Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> John 3. 34. where he ſaith, that <hi>God giveth not his Spirit by meaſure to him;</hi> And he interprets it to be without meaſure, and by conſequence infinitely.</p>
               <p>But he is miſtaken, for there is a compariſon
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:48559:184"/> betwixt Chriſt and <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and other Miniſters of the Church, for they received the Spirit, and are limitted and ſtinted, and receive not all that they are capable of, and muſt have, but the Spirit is divided to them as it pleaſeth God; to one man is given Wiſdom, and to an other Knowledge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 11. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 7. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 3. but to Chriſt is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Spirit, not by meaſure, that is, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this meaſure; for Chriſt hath all theſe, and he hath the Spirit in perfection, and not imperfectly, as men here have; and he hath the whole as he is capable of, as man, but yet the whole is not infinite nor unmeaſurable: of which I have largely before ſpoken, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall not inlarge here.</p>
               <p>It may be further ſaid by way of negation, that all the knowledge that Chriſt hath received as man by the donation of the Spirit, doth not inable him as man, and being in heaven, to know the ſtate of all Saints in all places on earth, unleſs it be by revelation from God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and a new every moment: The reaſon is, becauſe as Chriſts body is confined to heaven, ſo his ſoul is confined to his body, and ſo the whole humane nature of Chriſt is confined to one place, and is not, neither can be preſent with one ſaint on earth, much leſs with all ſaints on earth; and without this preſence, there can be no knowledge; for Gods infinite knowledge
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:48559:184"/> is by his infinite preſence; but this hath alſo been ſpoken of before. And becauſe none can know the ſtate of ſaints but he that can know the heart of ſaints, but no creature doth this but he that made the heart, and gave to man knowledge, as the Scripture ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94. 8, 9, 10. and this is God alone.</p>
               <p>But he goeth on, and ſaith;</p>

                  <hi>Repl.</hi> The act of Interceſſion doth belong to Jeſus Chriſt as man, and the reaſon is ſtrong which he renders; but the ability to intercede, ſeeing it muſt be for all ſaints, according to their particular conditions and neceſſities, doth apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to Chriſt as God, and the validity of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion is bottomed there alſo.</p>
               <p>And whereas he ſpeaks of a communication of power from the Father, to know the ſtate of the Church; if he mean by it any inherent power or vertue reſiding in Chriſt, but given by the Father, by which Chriſt is inabled by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:48559:185"/> from time to time, to know all the hidden things, and deepeſt ſecrets, and the moſt inward thoughts and ways, and the moſt retired tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſpiritual neceſſities of the Church it is impoſſible, for the reaſons before mentioned; and becauſe there is not a greater thing by which the excellency and glory of that infinite wiſdom of God himſelf can be diſcovered and made known then this, to penetrate the hearts, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the motions of the ſpirits of men; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord himſelf by the Prophet <hi>Amos,</hi> reckons this, <hi>viz. the declaring unto man his thought,</hi> among the great, and proper, and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar works of God, which the creature cannot effect, whch require an infinite power, which no creature can be the ſubject of; in <hi>Amos</hi> 4. 13. <hi>For lo he that formeth the mountains, and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the wind, and declareth unto man his thought, &amp;c.</hi> and then he concludes, <hi>the Lord, the God of hoaſt is his Name.</hi> And becauſe both God himſelf, and the Prophets, and holy men of God have attributed it to God alone, as hath bin proved before, and you may diſcern from <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 11. that it is imprinted upon the very ſpirits and minds of the Heathen, to acknowledge a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarity in this thing to appertain to God. And becauſe its poſſible a like for the Father to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to the creature a power of being every where, as of knowing all things in all places, yea the moſt inſearchable things of all perſons with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:48559:185"/> any perſonal preſence, where ſuch perſons and things are: And indeed it may as rationally and as truly be aſſerted, that God may commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate his own nature and eſſence, and all his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes to the creature, as communicate this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute of omniſcience, or inveſt man with a power of knowing of the ſtate of all ſaints, which is all one; for what is it that God cannot give a power to know, if he can give power to know the inclinations, hidden motions, ſecret work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and abſtruſe actings of the ſoul and ſpirit? and if God can make the creature to know as much as himſelf knows, by communication, then he can make the creature a God by communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. And if we look into the way by which God himſelf comes to know theſe things, we ſhall be able to diſcern that this knowledge cannot be communicated, becauſe all things and perſons are of God, and from God, and they live, move, and have their being in him, therefore it is impoſſible but that he ſhould be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all their actings, motions, and ways; but this is communicable which is the cauſe of this knowledge of God. God cannot make per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or things to have their ſubſiſtings and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the creature, and therefore he cannot communicate ſuch a power, and make it reſide in the creature, by which they may have ſuch a knowledge. The effect is no more communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then the cauſe is communicable.</p>
               <pb n="372" facs="tcp:48559:186"/>
               <p> But if he meaneth by a communication of power from the Father to know the ſtate of the Church, nothing elſe but Gods revealing to Chriſt in heaven from time to time, the ſtate and condition of the Church, and of all ſaints, as he did to <hi>Daniel Nebuchadnezars</hi> Dream which was gone from him; this will be granted as poſſible in reference to the creature, but this is not properly a communication of power to the creature from the Father; but the manifeſtation of Gods Wiſdom and Power by the creature, and the creature is not the ſubject of it in which this wiſdom reſides, but God himſelf. But this is not ſutable to Chriſt, to ſay that what know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Chriſt hath in heaven of the affairs of the Church, and ſtate of the ſaints, is by Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation; for this would make Chriſt a Prieſt of like imperfection which was in the high Prieſts, for they were capable of revelation alſo as well as Chriſt, if God had pleaſed to have manifeſted himſelf unto them in the diſcovery of the Churches wants; but it behoved Chriſt to be more excellent, to be a Prieſt not in weakneſs, but in ſtrength, and to be able to ſave to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, and conſequently to have the ability of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceding in himſelf. For to be able to ſave by anothers ſtrength, is ſuch an ability as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, when he ſaith, <hi>I am able to do all things through Christ ſtrengthning of me:</hi> ſuch ability is inability, it is to be unable rather then able in
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:48559:186"/> and of himſelf; as a child that is moved by the ſtrength of the arms of the Mother, or as a ſick man that is upheld in his walking; which makes nothing to the glory of Chriſt at all, but is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor to him: and hence it is that it was needful that Chriſt ſhould be God and man in one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that he might be the ſubject of this power, and that he might by himſelf ſave us. Beſides, it is unſcriptural to ſay that the Father reveals the ſtate of the Church to Chriſt, and that Chriſt knows it not till then. Yea, it is repugnant to the Scripture, for it is ſaid Chriſt is <hi>he that ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the heart, &amp;c.</hi> he knows, becauſe he ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and not becauſe it is revealed to him.</p>
               <p>But he paſſeth from this ninth Argument, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence to viſit my tenth, and yet ſaith ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a word to it, but refers me to his anſwer to <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 20. <hi>I am with you alwaies to the end of the world.</hi> But whether this be ſollidly or ſlightly done, I ſhall leave to the Reader to judge after I have preſented it to his view.</p>
               <p>The tenth Argument or Inſtance was this;</p>
            </div>
            <div n="10" type="instance">
               <p>Inſt. 10. <hi>If Chriſt be a meer creature, then how can he protect, and defend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſave, and direct, and rule, and govern his Church in all the world, in every condition, and againſt all enemies, he being at ſuch a diſtance and remoteneſs from the Church? and yet it is ſaid of him, that he is able to ſave to the utmoſt thoſe that come to God by him,</hi> Heb. 1. 25. <hi>and that he is with them to the</hi>

               <p>The Reader may eaſily obſerve that the force of this Inſtance lies in two particulars eſpecially; 1. If he be a meer creature, how will he be able, how can he have power to perform ſuch acts as thoſe are that are mentioned, conducing to the ſafety and welfare of his Church, having ſuch enemies to conflict with, and ſuch evils to ſave from? 2. How can he do it at ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance? How can he do it he being in heaven, and they being on earth? What vertue is that that is in Chriſt as meer man, that reacheth the Saints in all places, and is ſufficient to preſerve, and keep, and rule, and govern them? He may alſo caſt his eye upon the Scriptures which I quote, of which <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 20. is but one, to which he refers me; and the reſt he paſſeth over in ſilence, as if they were all of them anſwered in his anſwer to <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 20. but let his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to that text be ſurveyed, and it will appear to be otherwiſe; I ſhall re-mind the Reader of the ſum of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſe works of inſtructing, comforting strengthning, he doth in his abſence by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,

If it be, then Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is not a ſufficient Saviour, but Chriſt and the Spirit together; or rather, Chriſt is inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, but the Spirit is ſufficient, and yet but a creature, and inferiour to Chriſt, and his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But the Apoſtles deſigne is to ſet out, not the Spirits ſufficiency, but Chriſts ſufficiency. Much leſs is ſatisfaction given by this anſwer of his to <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 11. where it is ſaid, that <hi>the Lord ſtood by</hi> Paul, <hi>and ſaid, be of good cheer</hi> Paul, <hi>for as thou hast teſtified of me at Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, ſo must thou bear witneſs of me at Rome.</hi> Suppoſe this were done in a Viſion, yet the Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is of Chriſt, not of the Spirit, I have not ſaid that the Spirit ſtood by the Lord, and it is the preſence of Chriſt himſelf, and the conſolation of Chriſt himſelf that <hi>Paul</hi> in this Viſion is inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, though neither the Father nor the holy Ghoſt is to be excluded; for Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt are all of them preſent with all ſaints alwaies, and do all of them work the ſame work, the order ſtill obſerved: So that when it
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:48559:188"/> is ſaid that the Father and the Son do inſtruct or protect by the Spirit, it muſt not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that they are <hi>cauſa adjuvantes,</hi> cauſes helping one another; for all of them are all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, and all of them do effect the whole work in ſuch an order of working: much leſs that the Spirit is only operative, and the Father and Son are inactive in the work, and are onely authorative in it, and do imploy the Spirit, as their inſtrument; as the lord of the houſe doth act things by his ſervants, whom he imploys as meſſengers to effect ſuch things, or whom he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points or deſigns for ſuch undertakings; for ſo would he have us to conceive of Chriſt, that he doth nothing himſelf, but is contained in heaven, and is neither preſent, nor acts any thing on earth, but ſends the Spirit to effect all for him, and this Spirit is preſent, and doth all that is done, and Chriſt himſelf doth nothing: For this is confuted in this Viſion, where the Lord ſhew, himſelf preſent, and he himſelf gives out the word <hi>of good cheer,</hi> and effects it alſo by his own power.</p>

                  <hi>Repl.</hi> Here is a bundle of concluſions, and monſtrous untruths packed up together. 1. He ſaith, <hi>By the rule of the Goſpel we are to pray to God, or the Father, in the name of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which being taken excluſively (as he muſt needs underſtand it, elſe he ſpeaks at randome, and not to the thing) <hi>viz.</hi> that prayer to Chriſt is againſt the rule of the Goſpel, is very falſe; and herein he condems the generation of Gods children, and
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:48559:189"/> 
                  <hi>Stephen</hi> more eſpecially, who prayed to God the Son; for every Text of Scripture that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns prayer to God, enjoyns it to the whole Trinity, to Father, Son, and Spirit, and not to the Father only; becauſe there is no God but he, who is one in Eſſence, and three in perſons, as hath been proved before. And let him ſhew that rule that enjoyns prayer to God, <hi>viz.</hi> the Father, excluding the Son and the holy Ghoſt, if he can; and if he cannot, let him bluſh for ſhame becauſe he hath aſſerted it; and he hath offended here againſt the generation of the ſaints, who have been wont to pray to God in the perſon of the Son, not excluding the Father and the Spirit. <hi>Stephen</hi> is an example of ſuch a practiſe, and many more beſides him; in <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 59. <hi>They ſtoned</hi> Stephen, <hi>calling upon God and ſaying, Lord Jeſus receive my ſpirit.</hi> It was the ſecond perſon, the Son who took fleſh, and is God in fleſh, that was called upon, and prayed unto, and muſt he be made a Tranſgreſſor?</p>
               <p>But he ſaith, <hi>I have nothing to countenance prayer to Chriſt but theſe two Texts which I mention, this of</hi> Stephen, <hi>and that other of</hi> John. But this is as groſs an untruth as the former, yea more palpable to all mens eyes then the former, for in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 2. all ſaints are deſcribed to be ſuch <hi>who call upon the name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> prayed familiarly to Chriſt, in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8, 9. <hi>For this I beſought</hi>
                  <pb n="379" facs="tcp:48559:189"/> 
                  <hi>the Lord;</hi> what Lord was this? It was the Lord Chriſt: How may that appear? From the anſwer that he received, and the uſe he made of it; the anſwer was, <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee, My power is made perfect in weakneſs:</hi> the uſe that he makes of it is this, <hi>moſt gladly therefore will I glory in my infirmities, that the power of Chriſt may reſt upon me.</hi> The power that is made perfect in weakneſs, is the power of Chriſt. And in 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 16, 17. <hi>Now the Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, and God, even our Father, comfort your hearts, &amp;c.</hi> The Apoſtle if he pray to the Father, he prays to the Son alſo, for he joyns them both together, and gives Chriſt in this place, herein the preheminence, that he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Chriſt before the Father in this prayer.</p>
               <p>But he excepts againſt theſe two examples of <hi>Stephen</hi> and <hi>John;</hi> firſt he makes a queſtion of it, whether <hi>Stephen</hi> did pray directly to Chriſt or not; for he expreſſeth himſelf with an <hi>(if)</hi> as if he doubted; but to doubt in plain things is fooliſhneſs, and to ſtumble where there is no ſtone to ſtumble at, is perverſneſs. It will be granted (I hope) that he prayed to him to whom he ſpake; but he ſpake to Chriſt; and the words in the Greek make it clear, <hi>They ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> Stephen, <hi>calling upon and ſaying, Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus receive my ſpirit;</hi> there is none other men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned but the Lord Jeſus upon whom he called, and to whom he ſaid, <hi>receive my ſpirit;</hi> and he
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:48559:190"/> warrants it by <hi>Chriſts viſible appearance, as Lots prayer unto the Angels</hi> being viſible; but what viſible appearance was there when <hi>Paul</hi> prayed to Chriſt in the forementioned places? or when all the Saints prayed to Chriſt, as the Apoſtle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates the practiſe to be in the primitive times? what ſight had they firſt of Chriſt before they prayed? did Chriſt appear viſibly to every one of them firſt? what a groundleſs conceit is this, and how far from truth? beſides, what did ſuch a viſible ſight advantage him, when he ſaw him in heaven; for unleſs it were in a viſion that he ſaw him, it was in heaven that he ſaw him; and if ſo, the diſtance was as great as if he had not ſeen him, therefore it could not be bottomed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ground; for Chriſt was never a whit the more preſent becauſe <hi>Stephen</hi> ſaw him: And ſo the example of <hi>Lots</hi> praying to the Angel is no whit ſutable, becauſe the Angel was not onely viſible, but preſent.</p>
               <p>But what doth he mean by bringing in ſuch an inſtance of <hi>Lots</hi> praying to an Angel? will he ſet on foot the doctrine of invocation upon ſaints and Angels by it? If he would do it, that inſtance which he brings of <hi>Lot,</hi> will not help, him at all, it was neither of the two Angels that <hi>Lot</hi> prayed to, that he received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his houſe and lodged, but the third Angel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom <hi>Abraham</hi> ſtood, who was now come to the other two, and this was <hi>Jehovah</hi>
                  <pb n="381" facs="tcp:48559:190"/> in the perſon of the Son, who often appeared as an Angel, which appeareth from, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. <hi>ver.</hi> 17. When they had brought them forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, <hi>he ſaid eſcape for thy life;</hi> that is when the two Angels which came firſt to <hi>Lot</hi> had brought <hi>Lot,</hi> and his wife and daughters out, <hi>he ſaid,</hi> that is, netiher of the two Angels, for they are mentioned joyntly all along, and neither of them ſingled out from the other, but it was the third Angel, or <hi>Jehovah</hi> (as he is called) that appeared now to <hi>Lot,</hi> and this was he to whom he prayed. This appears further from <hi>ver.</hi> 22. 23, 24. <hi>I can do nothing</hi> ſaith this Angel to whom <hi>Lot</hi> prayed, <hi>till thou come thither</hi> and afterward it is ſaid, <hi>the Lord rained &amp;c.</hi> in the Hebrew <hi>Jehovah rained &amp;c. from Jehovah,</hi> the Son from the Father: It was he that rained fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone that ſaid before to <hi>Lot,</hi> in anſwer to his prayer, <hi>I have accepted thee in this thing; haſte thee thither, for I can do nothing till thou come thither:</hi> and this is called <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and it is ſaid <hi>he rained from Jehovah.</hi> So that he is groſly miſtaken in this alſo, about <hi>Lots</hi> praying to a creature Angel, by which he would prove it warrantable to pray to a creature Chriſt, but puts it upon the viſibleneſs of him, when yet this Angel was not only viſible, but preſent; and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah</hi> in the perſon of a man.</p>
               <p>He alſo excepts againſt <hi>John's</hi> prayer, he ſaith <hi>it was an intimation of the Churches deſire after</hi>

And whereas he ſaith, if is <hi>but an intimation of deſire, and no pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> he ſhewes himſelf ignorant of the nature of prayer; for what is prayer, but an intimation of the deſire of a perſon, to one that is able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer him in it. And what are thoſe expreſſions of the Apoſtles, in their Epiſtles to the Churches, but prayers for them &amp; yet they are intimations of the Apoſtles deſires; <hi>Grace be with you, and Peace from God the Father, and from Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.

Whether <hi>Stephen</hi> ſaw Chriſt by the ſtrength of his own natural ey ſight? if ſo, why did not all the reſt ſee Chriſt as well as he? if not, then he was ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſee that which he ſaw, and ſo it was no leſs then wonderfull, that he ſaw Chriſt; God, by the greatneſs of his power made <hi>Stephen</hi> to ſee Chriſt; and ſo it may be granted that God by the exceeding greatneſs of his power, might inable the man Chriſt, or Chriſt according to his manhood to hear <hi>Stephen,</hi> but then it is a thing above nature, and ſo it comes to this, that Chriſt as man is not able but is only capable of being made able, and prayer to Chriſt is not to be bottomed upon that. 3. Whether it was the voice that <hi>Stephen</hi> uttered that was the cauſe
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:48559:192"/> of Chriſts hearing <hi>Stephen?</hi> or whether if there had been no voice, Chriſt could not have heard the voice of the heart, the motions of it, the cry of it? if Chriſt could notwithſtanding have heard, as is apparent from other Scriptures, then it was not the eare of the body, or the fleſhly eare with which Chriſt heard <hi>Stephen,</hi> but it was by that vaſt boundleſs knowledge, which Chriſt had, as the Son of God, and as God, and by which the diſciples told him that <hi>he knew all things:</hi> and then the compariſon which he makes betwixt Chriſt and <hi>Stephen,</hi> the one's ſeeing, and the other's hearing, might have been ſpared, for the things are not alike in which the compariſon was made. And this ſhewes the abſurdity of his imagination, <hi>viz.</hi> that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that Chriſt hath, being in heaven, of the prayers that are made on earth to him, by the hearing of the eare.</p>

               <p> He attemps according to his manner, to put this argument into forme, but fouly miſtakes himſelf therein, for it comes miſhapen from him, he cannot reduce it to moode and figure; either he was never Maſter of that Art, and ſo attempts things out of his Element, or elſe he hath greatly forgot himſelf, for it is no Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſme as he hath ſhapen it. I ſhall firſt preſent it to the Reader, and then ſhew how it ought to have been formed.</p>
               <p>That Doctrine which makes a meer creature the Judge of the world, is againſt the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 5, 6.</p>
               <p>But Chriſt is the Judge of the world, Therefore</p>
               <p>That Doctrine that makes Chriſt a meer creature is againſt the ſcripture, Thus he.</p>
               <p>That this argument is beſide rule, appeares by this; becauſe every regular Sylogiſme hath but three terms in it, viz. the <hi>Subject,</hi> the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate,</hi> and the <hi>Medium,</hi> but this Sylogiſme of his, hath 4 termes in it.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. There is the <hi>Subiect,</hi> viz, <hi>that Doctrine that makes Chriſt a meer creature.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. There is the <hi>Predicate,</hi> viz. <hi>is againſt the Scripture.</hi>

                  <item>3. There is the <hi>Medium,</hi> viz. <hi>that Doctrine which makes a meer creature the judge of the world.</hi>

                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Therefore it is plaine that the Sylogiſme is falſe, and it ought to have been thus formed,</p>
               <p>That Doctrine which makes a meer creature the judge of the world, is againſt the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</p>
               <p>But that Doctrine which makes Chriſt a meer creature, is a Doctrine that makes a meer creature the judge of the world, Therefore,</p>
               <p>That Doctrine that makes Chriſt a meer creature is againſt the Scripture.</p>
               <p>I thought good to preſent this errour of his to the Readers view, becauſe my paper being never intended for him, was in a plaine facile way penned, that it might be the better conceived of by ſuch to whom I preſented it, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not rules of diſputing; but he puts all into a ſcholaſtique forme, and would not incounter with me in that plain way of arguing, with this deſigne (as he pretended) to make my weakneſs the more obvious, but ſure I am whether my weakneſs be obvious or not, his over ſight (that I ſay no worſe) is obvious in tranſgreſſing the rules of arguing which yet himſelf chuſeth, as pretending to have skill in them.</p>
               <p>And whereas he anſwers to both propoſitions, his labour might have been ſpared, in reference to the Minor propoſition, which is undoubtedly
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:48559:193"/> true, as appears from the ſyllogiſme rightly fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; for who can deny but that doctrine which makes Chriſt a meer creature, makes a meer creature judge of the world?</p>
               <p>The Major Propoſition can therefore only be denyed by him, and indeed he doth deny it. 1. By propoſing of examples of creatures who ſhall judge the world. 2. By diſtinguiſhing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ſupreme judge of the worrd, and a delegate Judge; and grants the propoſition to be true, only in reference to the principal or ſupreme Judge, but aſſerts it to be falſe of the delegate Judge. And this he doth with a great deal of confuſion, for I rather repreſent what he would ſay, then what he doth ſay.</p>
               <p>Firſt he tels us of the Apoſtles. <hi>That they ſhall ſit upon twelve Thrones, judging tbe twelve Tribes of Iſrael,</hi> Mat. 19. 28. and then he tells us of the ſaints, that <hi>they ſhall judge the world,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 2, 3. and then tells me, <hi>that doubtleſs I had not this text of Corinths when I brought this Argument in my thoughts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> Whether I had this text of the Corinths in my mind in that very moment when I penned down this Argument, I am not able to ſay; but I would not have him to be conceited as if he had brought ſome new and ſtrange thing to my knowledge, which before I underſtood not, as his words do import, which are theſe; <hi>What will you ſay if I ſhall ſhew you from the Word that</hi>
                  <pb n="388" facs="tcp:48559:194"/> 
                  <hi>the Apoſtles ſhall be Judges at the laſt day, and that the Saints ſhall judg the World?</hi> Alas, alas, that man that ſhall be non-pluſs'd with the ſhewing of ſuch a thing as this, is but poorly learned in Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>It is eaſily anſwered, that though the Apoſtles and Saints ſhall judg the world, &amp;c. yet they are no where called the Judges of the World: And their judging is Catacherſtically, and very improperly ſo called. The Apoſtles more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially are ſaid to judg the twelve Tribes, or the World, becauſe as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>all ſhall be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to their Goſpel, Rom.</hi> 2. 16. and both Apoſtles and Angels do judg the World, as Aſſeſſores, as <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> ſaith, <hi>Chriſtus Apoſtolos &amp; Sanctos omnes cooptavit aſſeſſores;</hi> They ſit after the manner of Juſtices of the Peace upon the Bench, and hear all, and allow of all, and approve of all, and allow of all, and conſent to all, and are Witneſſes of Chriſts righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous proceedings, and in no other ſence can they be ſaid to judg; and what hath he gained by this? and what doth his new diſcovery, which he thought I never thought of, amount to?</p>
               <p>His diſtinction is to better purpoſe which he brings afterward, of <hi>principal Judg,</hi> and <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate or Deputy Judg;</hi> and yet it will not mar my Market, as he imagines; his words are.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In a ſence it is true, no creature can be Judg</hi>
                  <pb n="389" facs="tcp:48559:194"/> 
                  <hi>but God, that is principal in Government, God being both the Alpha and Omega of it, deriving his power from none, being the Original of all power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And afterward he lays down two Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the moſt high God, who is the Worlds principal Judg, will not immediately, but by a Delegate, judg the World,</hi> Acts 17. 31. John 5. 22. 1 Cor. 15. 28.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt is ſubordinate Judg, in reference unto God the ſupream Judg, but ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendent in reference to the Saints,</hi> Act. 10. 42. &amp; 3. 20. Mat. 16. 27. Joh. 5. 27.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> One diſtinction which hath been often given, and is ordinary and familiar with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, of no vaſt knowledg, will ſatisfie the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and anſwer all the Scriptures, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile all ſeeming differences. The moſt high God, who as Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, in each perſon, is the Worlds principal Judg, and every perſon not excluding the other is ſo. And Chriſt, as he is the ſecond Perſon in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, as he is the Son, and as he is equal with the Father, is the Worlds principal Judg, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a part from the fleſh, which he hath now aſſumed, the Father and the Holy Ghoſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. And this I prove from Scripture, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 26. The Perſon before whom <hi>Abraham</hi> ſtood was Chriſt, the ſecon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Iehovah,</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> calls him <hi>the Iudg of all the Earth:</hi> And in <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 24. he acted as a Judg; he Jehovah the Son, rained fire and brimſtone upon <hi>Sodom</hi> from Jehovah his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 45. 22, 23. Chriſt calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>God,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>there is none elſe;</hi> and ſaith, that <hi>every knee ſhall bow to him,</hi> that is, in the day of Judgment, as the Apoſtle (an Expoſitor without exception) holds forth in <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 10, 11. But Chriſt as conſidered in fleſh, being found in faſhion as a man, as he is Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and man, being both God and man in one Perſon, is deſigned and ordained by the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt to judg the world in righteouſneſs, as from <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 31. he proves. And ſo the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt judg no man, but have committed all Judgment to the Son in fleſh, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 22. and in the Son in fleſh they judg, and this Power and Honour hath he received as Mediator in fleſh; but when all enemies are ſubdued and judged, then he ſhall deliver up this Kingdom and Power, and Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, the one true God, who ſhall be all in all, and the Son himſelf according to the fleſh ſhall be ſubject. And in this ſence as Mediator in fleſh, he may be called a delegate Judg; for that the humane Nature of Chriſt ſhould be taken up into the fellowſhip of this Glory with the eternal Son, this was by
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:48559:195"/> ordination. As the Son in fleſh had been hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, ſo the fleſh with the Son muſt be exalted to this Glory, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 9, 10. And the Glory which Chriſt hath as Mediator, is founded upon Chriſts ſonſhip in this reſpect as Judg, as in all other reſpects, &amp; indeed in any other reſpect but as the Son, he is not capable of being Judg; for though whole Chriſt be Judg, yet the natural right to it, and ability to perform it, is as he is the Son; and that the whole in both Natures is Judg, is of grace, And can any rational man think, that Chriſt a meer man ſhould be able to judg the ſecrets of men, if he were not God as wel as man; ſo that that honor to judg as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, is given to him in fleſh, as declarative of that eſſential Power and Glory which he had as Son with the Father and Spirit from Eternity, that all might honour the Son with the equal ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour as the Father is honoured.</p>
               <p>And whereas he ſaith, That the Father is principal in Judgment, and is the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> of it, alluding to the place where the Father is ſo called, why ſhould not the Son be principal in Judgment with the Father, being the Alpha and Omega of it, ſeeing he alſo is ſo called in Scripture.</p>
               <p>Thus I have followed him in all his Evaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſhifts, and have unmasked his Anſwers, and plucked off the fair Vizard that he had put upon them, and have diſcovered the deceit, and found
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:48559:196"/> fraud, and falſhood that was hid under them. And I have vindicated the reſt of the Scriptures that I alledged from his corrupt Interpretations that he put upon them, and have confirmed the Arguments which I produced, and they now abide in their ſtrength, and have removed and taken out of the way that which troubled their Teſtimony, which they brought to the Godhead of Chriſt, that they could not be heard, by reaſon of the noiſe that his Anſwers made in mens ears.</p>
               <p>Let it be conſidered from firſt to laſt, what a poor, weak feeble, baſe, mean, contemptible, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſeable Chriſt, Saviour, Mediator, Interceſſor he makes this great God and our Lord Jeſus to be; and what a penurious, defective lame, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly righteouſneſs and ſatisfaction he brings unto us for our ſupport and how ſhamefully and reproachfully he ſtrips him, robs him of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Glory in all things that is due unto him: The worſhip which he muſt have, can but amount to Reverence, which is only due to one, that hath the meer honour to come in the name of another, which is all he grants to Chriſt; for he denies him to be the ultimate object of worſhip, and there is no intermediate object of worſhip which is not founded in the ultimate or laſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: and all that come in Gods name, <hi>Moſes</hi> and all the Prophets ſhare with him upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in this reverence. And he cannot be the object of faith at all, according to him, but a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:48559:196"/> or mean by which we come to believe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n him who is the object or end; and ſuch is the wtitten Word of God and all the publiſhers of it, mediums or means by which we come to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on God; and herein Chriſt is become like one of them. This is an humbling of him with a witneſs: and he is but an inſtrumental Saviour whoſe vertue is in an other according to him, as there have bin many ſince the beginning of the world, and ſtill are; the beaſts which were ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed, and the Prieſts who ſacrificed them, were inſtrumental ſaviours; and now the Goſpel, and the Preachers thereof are inſtrumental ſaviours, and Gods appointment and aſſiſtance (which he ſaith Chriſt had) might have made them (as he muſt needs grant) as effectual as he; thus he le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels Chriſt &amp; brings him down from his height to be like to other things, which are fellow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments with him. And ſo he makes Chriſt to be a meer mediator by aſſiſtance, but impotent in himſelf; for ſaith he, what work ſoever you can inſtance in belonging to Chriſts mediatorſhip of himſelf he was not able to perform it, unleſs by the aſſiſtance of another and ſo he was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Mediator; and ſo might <hi>Moſes</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man be: and thus he is made weak and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble like one of us, not having the leaſt ſufficiency of himſelf, but a capacity to partake of Gods ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, which alſo may be predicated of any other perſon, they may not ſay they are able to
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:48559:197"/> do all things that God will call them forth to, through Gods ſtrengthning them; and he makes Chriſt to be but an inſtrumental Agent in that righteouſneſs by which believers are juſtified: an inſtrumental Agent alſo in forgiving ſins; he doth but act about theſe things, is not the Author of them: and herein other men have the ſame priviledge. He himſelf tels us that it is the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſome men to forgive all ſins in reference to the curſe of the Law, and he quotes <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 23. which is to be underſtood in a declarative way, and Chriſt hath no greater honour then this. The ſatisfaction alſo of Chriſt is rather ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of grace, as he preſents it, then ſatisfaction of juſtice; it is ſatisfaction without any proportion to the offence. As he lays it down he doth in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect bring in God ſpeaking of it, as the Apoſtle brings in God ſpeaking of mercy, <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy;</hi> and ſo he, <hi>I wil be ſatisfied wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h what I wil be ſatisfied with,</hi> whether it be proportionable or not without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to juſtice. And his ability to intercede ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the condition and neceſſity of the Church, is not from himſelf nor in himſelf, but from a communication of power from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And for judging he doth it in an inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal way and hath all ſaints copartners with him in the work, ſharing in the like honor only he is ſuperintendent in it, which belongs rather to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then to power.</p>
               <pb n="395" facs="tcp:48559:197"/>
               <p> After this manner he deals with Chriſt, who was, and is, and ever will be in the form of God, and equal with God, with him he deals thus; humbling him abaſing him, and making him in all things to be like unto men, proportioning him, and equalling him to others, not by vayling his his glory and majeſty, but by denying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it; which is the higheſt indignity that can be offered to this Lord of glory. And yet (which is not a little to be wondred at, and ſorrowed for) how many are there who will not underſtand this, but cry him up for a great advancer of Chriſt, yea he is made ſuperlative herein! they ſay he exalts Chriſt above all that ever they heard preach him; but either they declare their groſs ignorance, or ſomthing that is worſe. They may ſow fig-leaves together to cover his nakedneſs, and hide his ſhame, but if they be intelligent perſons, they muſt needs know that the ſubſtance and truth of divine glory and excellency is plucked off, and torn away from him, and that the ſhaddow only remaineth; he hath taken away all glorying from Chriſt, as the Apoſtle took it away from ſaints; it may be ſaid of Chriſt, as of others; <hi>What haſt thou</hi> oh Chriſt, <hi>which thou haſt not received?</hi> Chriſt hath received more of Gods grace, and is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to the moſt high, and that is all he can glory of according to him, for he hath nothing of his own to glory of.</p>
               <p>And yet many poor Chriſtians though thus defrauded &amp; cheated of the true Chriſt, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:48559:198"/> with the Chriſt which he obtrudeth upon them, and bleſs themſelves with the knowledge of ſuch a Chriſt which he hath ſhaped out, or miſhaped rather, who holds no proportion with that which Scripture hath limned out and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to us; yet they rejoyce and glory in this Chriſt. O miſerable darkneſs and blindneſs (that I ſay not perverſneſs) in men, in Chriſtians, that they do not diſcover how great and dangerous the cheat is! Oh how dangerous is this? If God ſhould not be merciful to them, and open their eys to ſee the horridneſs of it, what would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of them? Such an impotent weak Chriſt who could not ſave himſelf by any ſtrength in himſelf, is unlike to ſave them. And thus far in Anſwer to him and his book.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe I diſcern that very ſtrange and very unſafe opinions are very rife in this Nation, and very deteſtable and horrid doctrines are ſet to ſale, and many come (who have been accounted and no queſtion ſome of them are ſo) very pretious Chriſtians, and cheapen them, and (be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p n="3">3. Many of the people are weake and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious, and have not a good root of knowledge in them, they do not know things in the reaſons and cauſes of them; but have received the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the truth without the ground of it; they have not a deep inſight, but a ſuperficiall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge onely; and have ſeen the out ſide, but know not the miſtery within; and ſo it comes that with every wind of Doctrine they are ſhaken, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 14. through the ſlight of men and cunning craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs: for it is eaſy to preſent things with another face, while perſons look not after that which is within, and the fraud and falſhood comes not to be diſcerned, for the net and the ſnare is not in ſight, and that which is ſpecious is only preſented.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Many perſons are ambitious after knowledge that they may increaſe it, and are wholy given (as the Athenians to underſtand news, ſo they) to underſtand Doctrine, &amp; to arrive at higher notions and conceptions, nor for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, nor in affection to the truth, but to furniſh themſelves unto diſcourſe and to increaſe their repute, and ſo they become ſwift in hearing, and quick in receiving,
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:48559:200"/> any new Doctrine, and God gives them up to ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions that they may believe lyes. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 10 &amp;c. who neither ſeek nor receive the truth in the love of it, that they may be ſaved, but that they may be praiſed.</p>

Perſons that have a real inplantation into Chriſt, and thoſe that have onely a viſible and formal inplantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but want a true ingraftment, they live together, not only in the world but in the Church of Chriſt alſo, and are under ſome droppings and waterings of external en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, and have a name to live and yet are truly dead; and the honour and praiſe of thoſe that are ſaints indeed are put upon them. Now God that diſcernes betwixt the ſheep and the goats, and ſeperates betwixt them, and he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo who unmaskes hypocrites, and pluckes the vizard off from them, he that can diſtinguiſh betwixt the natural complexion in his own people, and the paintings of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who pretend to him, but are none of his, he in his providence brings an houre of temptation both upon the one and other, he tryes them both with the wind of falſe Doctrine, and hereſie, and for this end he doth it, that they which are approved may be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="6">6 Many perſons forſake, or never put themſelves in to that order which Chriſt hath appointed for Saints to walk in, in which they might be watched over, and ſo kept, by which meanes they are in a ſtate, as ſheep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhepheards, and when the Wolfe commeth they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a prey; for the ſhep are not able through weakneſs and ſimplicity to defend themſelves, if there be no ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard to provide for their ſafety: and poor weak well mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Chriſtians are leſs able; ſheep will fly from danger though that doth not ſave <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="401" facs="tcp:48559:200"/>
               <p> The Apoſtle declares how he himſelf watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the ſpace of three yeers, with many teares, to prevent this evill of the flock being devoured by Wolves; and he calls the Elders of <hi>Epheſus</hi> together, and gives them this charge, that they would <hi>take heed to themſelves and to the flock over which the holy Ghoſt hath made them overſeers, to feed the Church of God,</hi> that is, with ſound incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt doctrine; and he renders this reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>after his deceaſe grievous Wolves ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in not ſparing the flock, and men of perverſe minds amongſt themſelves,</hi> Acts 20. 28, 29, 30. And it is to be obſerved, that ſuch perſons, how wiſe ſoever, how holy ſoever they do profeſſe to be, and really may be, who caſt off Ordinances and Churches, and Miniſtry, and ſay there are now no Paſtours, nor Teachers, nor flocks committed to them, as in Primitive times there were, and ſo withdraw themſelves from the vigilancie of ſuch Shepheards, of all Chriſtians they are the moſt unſtable and the moſt apt to erre and go aſtray, and the moſt apt to entertaine ſtrange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptural doctrine; and the reaſon of this is, not becauſe of the wiſdome and righteouſneſſe of ſuch perſons who are Paſtours and Teachers, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other men, as if they by their prudence and underſtanding and holineſs were able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve thoſe that are committed to them, from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, but becauſe it is the Ordinance of Chriſt that Saints ſhould be in fellowſhips, and ſhould have
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:48559:201"/> Paſtors and Teachers as Guides, and Watchmen, and Overſeers over them, therefore a bleſſing goes along with it for the moſt part; and thoſe that caſt off this Order, are left very much to themſelves, and deſerted of Chriſts ſtrength, not being found in Chriſts way: Yet it is not arroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to aſſert that Paſtors and Teachers either are, or ought to be the moſt prudent, and moſt ſober minded, and beſt tempered, and beſt ſetled and ſtabliſhed, and moſt firmly rooted and grounded, and each way the moſt able of the body, to which they do belong for they are by office as eyes to the reſt of the members.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Many unite and congregate together with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any that are competently furniſhed with gifts among them to be Paſtors and Teachers, neither having any in their eye whom they may call ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to and obtaine; and being thus in fellowſhip, they propound the edifying of one another by holding out their conceptions each perſon to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, both in prophecy and in conference, and in this caſe much comes to be ſpoken, and perhaps in ſome places none able to judge, and he that hath the ripeſt and accuteſt parts leads the reſt; &amp; if he be not very ſober minded, he is ſure to lead them into error; the ſad effects of this I have much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. Now this is more dangerous in theſe times then it would have been in ſome other ages, becauſe corrupt doctrine is very rife, and one ſhall hardly live any where but there will not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:48559:201"/> that will caſt him into places and meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings where it will be vented, and if any be taken therewith, he will be ſure to vent it, if he be not very humble when he is put upon exerciſe among thoſe he ſtands thus related to; and dangerous doctrine comes out in print, and may be read in books which are diſperſed abroad, and if perſons be not very well able to judge of them, but are deceived with faire pretexts, and if they have not ſetled, ſober, and well eſtabliſhed ſpirits, thoſe doctrines (of all other) will fall moſt under their obſervation, and will have the deepeſt impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and will be beſt remembred, and will be the ſooneſt communicated, becauſe of the rarity of them by ſuch perſons when they meet with the reſt of the body, eſpecially if ſuch perſons do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſingularity.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Many Paſtors and Teachers are men of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt judgments and unſound principles, and by reaſon of the opportunity that ſuch have of vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Tenents, and the intereſt that they have in their own flocks and other people to whom they preach, comes to paſſe that from them Error and Hereſie paſſeth into others that relate to them, and are hearers of them; and from hence it was that formerly, and of old, falſhoods and doctrines of lies diſperſed themſelves abroad, and filled the land.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But now the danger is leſſe in reference to the Miniſtry, becauſe it is but of little account a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:48559:202"/> many that pretend to Saintſhip, amongſt whom (I doubt not but that) ſome of them are truly good, at leaſt comparatively the eſteeme is ſmall to what it was. And this proceeds partly from the too much bitterneſſe and fierceneſſe which hath been ſhewed by many Miniſters, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch who have in the ſmalleſt points diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them, by which meanes they have eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the hearts of ſuch from them, and loſt their repute among them. And partly from that ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeking, and too much affectation of rule, and power, and preheminence which hath been juſtly obſerved to be in many Miniſters, the good of the flock having in the interim been much neglected, but though ſome are guilty herein, yet all connot be juſtly charged. And partly becauſe the juſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of propheſying (which belongs (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) without contradiction, to the people, if it be rightly bounded) hath been denied them by the generality of the Miniſters of this Nation, which have cryed out againſt it; whence it hath come to paſſe that many precious ones among the people have entertained thoughts, that the Miniſters deſigne hath been to keep them in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and to advance themſelves over them, and ſo they have broken from them, and have had them in diſeſteeme. But principally it comes to paſſe through the practiſe of ſome evill workers, who have aſperſed the Miniſtry more then there hath been cauſe, and have rendred them odious to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:48559:202"/> And now the danger of the ſpringing and ſpreading of Errors is more in reference unto theſe, who have withdrawn the affections of the people from the Miniſters, and have brought in themſelves into favour in ſtead of them, and are carried with thoſe temptations which they have been wont to charge the Miniſtry with, affecting ſingularity and preheminence, and would be thought to know much, and would be accounted Prophets and Teachers, and their deſigne is to draw away diſciples after them; and they affect new notions, and high expreſſions, which they perceive to be taking with the people, and ſo a door comes to be opened to Error.</p>
               <p n="10">10. There is an exorbitancy in that liberty which Saints have to exerciſe their gifts in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy. All the Brethren that are in a Church are not Prophets, that is, all have not the gift of Prophecy; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 29 <hi>and chap.</hi> 14. 1. But they muſt be proved firſt, and approved, before they take upon them to prophecie, and thoſe who are ſound and ſober ſhould only be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. What is ſpoken of Deacons, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 10. will hold in proportion to others, and hands muſt not be laid on ſuddenly, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. A ſudden approbation of any to office is not allowed, and there is the ſame reaſon for the exerciſe of gifts. As every one hath received a gift, ſo let him diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe it; there are private gifts, and there are publick gifts; there are gifts that may edifie a
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:48559:203"/> few, and there are gifts that may edifie many; there are gifts that may edifie weak ones, and there are gifts to edifie ſtrong ones; there are gifts that may edifie a family, and there are gifts that may edifie a Church; there are gifts that may edifie a part of the body, and there are gifts that may edifie the whole body; There may be profit in the exerciſe of ſome gifts to ſome, when there is no honour to Chriſt before men, that ſuch gifts ſhould be publickly exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. The Ordinances of God by this liberty, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warily and unſoberly uſed, fals under much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. Not but that I wiſh from my very ſoule that all the Lords people were Prophets, and that all had gifts by which all might edifie and be edified, and Chriſt glorified in all, who hath given ſuch gifts to men; but till there be ſuch a pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out of the ſpirit, let none be carried out beyond what he hath received, ſome have much more need to learn then to teach in an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>
               <p>And how can any preach unleſſe they be ſent, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 11. unleſſe perſons can aſſume to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and make out to others an immediate cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as the Apoſtles did. If they be not able to ſay that their calling to preach is not of men, nor by men, but by Jeſus Chriſt, then there muſt be an order in the Churches of Chriſt, and they muſt fall under it. If they think they have a gift, they muſt not exerciſe it becauſe they think
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:48559:203"/> ſo, but they muſt be called forth, and their gift tryed, &amp; the Church muſt judge. And unleſſe this Chriſtian-liberty of exerciſing gifts be thus boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, how wil the exorbitancy in the exerciſe of it be repreſſed? Many run upon this work being dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven therto by their luſts, I ſpeak what I know, and what many with me have had woful experience of. A flood-gate to errour is ſet open by this means, and I think truth hath been as much undermined by this one ſtratagem of Satan, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſetting up of multiplicity of teachers, as by any other policy of his, theſe many ages. The time was that the Miniſtry undermined prophecy in the gifted Saints, but the time is, that propheſie in thoſe that are (many of them neither gifted nor called, undermines Miniſtry. And the peoples ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are many of them inordinately carried, rather after prophecy, by the pooreſt, weakeſt, and raweſt perſons, that will conſume time that way, then after the beſt gifts that are miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially exerciſed among them. I am loth to ſay that ſuch who are exerciſed, and ſuch who put them upon it, and incourage them in it, do ſeek honour one of another, and not that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ſo much which is of God: but if I ſay that there is ſome temptation upon their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, ſure I am, I ſhall not miſſe it in reference un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many, and I charge not all. I am afraid leſt the times be come or coming, of which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3, 4. That ſound doctrine
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:48559:204"/> will not be endured, and that men after their luſts, will heap unto them teachers, having itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ears, and that they ſhall turn away their ears from the truth, and ſhall be turned after fables. For the laſt times are ſpoken of by <hi>Paul,</hi> and theſe are the laſt times; and now there are more teachers then all latter ages have ſhewed, and Truth hath leſſe acceptation among many then Errour, at leaſt the Reprovers of errour will not be endured, but ſuch ones in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to many perſons, makes themſelves a prey. And it is moſt certain, that there is a luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in perſons to partake of every mans gift, though he be a very ſtranger that is come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them under the profeſſion of a Saint, whoſe face they never ſaw before; and there muſt be ſome new notion preſented, or there will be but ſlender acceptation expreſſed. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to mourn for theſe things, of which there hath been very ſad experience in the parts where I have lived, and the conſequence hath been dreadful and detrimental to faith and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>I have cleared my ſelf from being any enemy to prophecying, yet leſt I ſhould be ſuſpected, I declare it again, that I am not againſt it, but I look upon it as an ordinance of Chriſt, if it be rightly regulated, and it is on foot in that fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of Saints to which I ſtand related; thoſe whom we have found competently furniſhed
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:48559:204"/> with the ſpirit for ſuch an undertaking, we have opened the door to, for an occaſional exerciſing of their parts; and we have ſhut it againſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers whom we have not conceived able; but I look upon that promiſcuous way, licentious liberty of prophecying by any that will put themſelves upon it, as unſcriptural and juſtly ſcandalous to many that are truly good And I conceive that at this door much errour hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in among us, for ſome are weak and erre in holding forth their conceptions; and ſome are immodeſt, and ſoare up in notions which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves underſtand not; and ſome are leavened, and are glad of an opportunity to vent ſuch opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions which they have received, and of which they are in travel, till they get a time to vent them and broach them to others.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Many receive ſtrangers in among them that have knowledge, and plauſible expreſſions, and ſeeming Sanctity, without inquiring after them, without aſſurance of their ſoundneſſe gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to them, without any letters of commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from known approved perſons or Churches concerning them, which the Primitive Saints and Churches expected and required, in reference to all ſtrangers that came among them, and it was found a neceſſary and a ſafe way for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Churches then, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 1, 2. and they are an example therein to us, for otherwiſe wolves may be entertained in ſtead of the Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:48559:205"/> and Preachers of Chriſt. The Apoſtles when they ſent meſſengers to other Churches, ſpeaks of choſen men, and paſſe a ſingular commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon them, that they might be received and credited: and they ſpeak of others that went out from them, but were not ſent, who had troubled them with words and ſubverted their ſouls, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 24, 25, 26. There is good doctrine in this hiſtory, and it was written for our learning that Saints and Churches may be warned, that they receive not any that are not ſent, that are not choſen men and known per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons among the Saints, for while they harbour ſuch, and intruſt their ſouls in their hands, they are miſled, and in danger to be deſtroyed.</p>
               <p n="12">12. There are many that have been raking in the filthy channel of all the old and horrid errors and hereſies of former ages, and have exſerted the Scriptures and Arguments, which they have judged moſt plauſible and taking with the people, wherewith ſuch opinions were fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and enforced, and have held forth as if they had received them through ſome divine light, that the ſpirit of God hath imparted to them, and they have been entertained by the people as ſingular revelations, and rare diſcoveries of the hidden truths of God, which God hath made known to ſuch who have had ſecret Communion with him, and ſo they have been infected and corrupted.</p>
               <p n="13">
                  <pb n="411" facs="tcp:48559:205"/> 13. Many are grown ſuſpicious of all that they have beleeved and received, as if all had been taken up by them upon tradition, and they give out that they muſt try all things, yea prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples themſelves, and that they muſt ſee with their own eyes, by which it appears that they profeſſe to be eſtabliſhed in nothing, rooted and grounded in nothing, and ſo they lie open to all danger, and are ſubject to be carried away with every winde of doctrine, for if any come to them in the habit of a Saint, pretending the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of divine myſteries, and be able to our-rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon them, or to preſent as they judge, ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable things to them, ſuch an one becomes prevalent, and draws away ſuch after him.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Many conceive that they are fallen into times of great diſcoveries, and that myſteries that have been hid from ages, are now revealed to the Saints.</p>
               <p>Whence it comes to paſſe, that if any ſtrange doctrine be broached, how horrid an errour ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, provided that plauſible grounds be laid down for it, it is preſently ſucked in and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, with apprehenſions that a doctrine that hath layn in darkneſſe many generations, is now manifeſted to the Saints; when as in truth and deed the foundation is truly laid already, and hath been truly built upon, elſe both we our ſelves &amp; Chriſtians of former ages were very wretched and miſerable, and that which Saints ſhall be
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:48559:206"/> heightned in is this, they ſhall know more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly what they knew more darkly, and that which the Saints have doubted of, and have been divided about, they ſhall underſtand.</p>
               <p n="15">15. The eſteem of Saints is now very low among many, unleſſe they be able to bring ſome doctrine which former ages have not known, or to produce ſome new notion and diſcourſe of ſome high point, which neither themſelves nor others do well underſtand; and unleſſe they be able to ſpeak in a language which the Chriſtians of former ages have not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, plain Scriptural language will not now ſatisfie, unleſſe there be high ſtrains which ſober Chriſtians have not been much acquainted with. This lays a temptation upon many precious ſouls, to affect and to ſeek after novelties, and ſo they come to be darkned with new errours that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, and are turned after fables.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing that I propounded to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſe, is the cauſes of the growth of errours, and how they come to ſpread.</p>
               <p>It is a certain truth, that that which begets them, doth alſo nouriſh them, and increaſe them, and ſo there muſt be a looking back to the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the ſpringing of them, and the ſelf-ſame things will be found, the cauſes of the ſpreading of them, and of the proſpering of them.</p>
               <p>Ignorance and pride, and affectation of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, praiſe and a corrupt conſcience, and unſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:48559:206"/> parts and gifts, and formal implantations into Chriſt without reality and power, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking the aſſembling of our ſelves together, and aſpiring unduly to prophecying without a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thereto; and many others that have been mentioned, theſe have given life to errours, and theſe have given ſtrength to them alſo.</p>
               <p>But there are ſome ſpecial cauſes of the growth of errours, divers from ſuch which have been already preſented as the riſe of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The cenſures of the Church are not duly exerciſed to repreſſe that inordinate luſting after ſtrange doctrine, and that pride, vain gloriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, vanity of ſpirit, and wantonneſſe of mind, with which many Saints are too much carried, and are ſick of; Not that I would have Saints caſt out of the Church, for every difference in judgement from their brethren, or diſſenting in opinion; thoſe that have known me, have known that I have been evermore a ſtranger to ſuch rigid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. I would not have ſo much as the peace of ſuch diſturbed in the leaſt kind by any, but if any opinion ſtrike at the foundation, threatning the overturning of it, and be very deſtructive to the faith and holineſſe of Saints, I think there is warrant enough, (and I hope I ſhall be able to make it out from Scripture) to proceed to the queſtioning and cenſuring of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who by other means cannot be reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:48559:207"/> And the neglecting of this ordinance of Chriſt is of evil conſequence unto the further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ripening of errour; for however it may be thought and ſpoken by ſome, that Church-cenſures bring no light to men with them, nor can be effectual for the conviction of perſons judgements (which hath truth in it,) yet the diſtemper of ſpirit (from which errour, when it is groſſe, doth as commonly ariſe as from weakneſſe of judgement) and unſoberneſſe of heart is healed and cured by Church cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Communion and fellowſhip with thoſe who are corrupt and unſound in their opinions, is not forborn, but there is the ſame liberty uſed of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with ſuch, and the ſame intimacy and familiarity ſhewed, as with any others how ſound ſoever; when yet the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void them,</hi> Rom. 16. 17. The Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>They were mingled among the Heathen, and learned their works.</hi> The latter followed upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>A little leaven leaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the whole lump,</hi> that is, when it is put to the whole lump, and is with it, but purge it out and it cannot; therefore his councel is <hi>To purge out the old leaven,</hi> which though it be ſpoken of the leaven of ungodlineſſe in perſons, is yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to the leaven of hereſie and errour, which is more infectious and ſpreading then the other.</p>

               <p>Obj. <hi>But ſuch perſons are Saints; why ſhould their Communion be declined?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Why doth God himſelf withdraw from Saints, and hide his face from them? is it not to humble them and make them aſhamed, and bring them to repentance? And may not, yea ought not we to withdraw from unſound and corrupt perſons (though they ſhould be Saints,) for the ſame reaſons? eſpecially ſeeing our own preſervation is in it.</p>
               <p>Obj.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But it will make diviſions among Saints to forbear the fellowſhip of ſuch, and it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce the common adverſarie, therefore for the ſcandal that is in it, ſuch withdrawing muſt not be allowed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> A holding of Communion with ſuch, will at laſt cauſe diviſion, and not a withdrawing from them, for ſuch who bring any other do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine by converſing with Saints, do get a Party, and ſo make diviſion. The Apoſtle declares whence diviſion proceeds, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 17. not from thoſe who ſhun Communion with leavened per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but from ſuch who are corrupt and leaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Mark thoſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>who cauſe diviſions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the doctrine that ye have received;</hi> Such perſons who bring unſcriptural doctrine cauſe the diviſions, for by their crafty inſinuations they deceive the ſimple, and draw away diſciples, and this ingenders a rent, for the reſt muſt oppoſe and reſiſt, unleſſe they alſo will become diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:48559:208"/> and if they do appear for the truth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the errour the reſt are carried away with, then there will be diviſion following upon it.</p>
               <p>As for the glorying of the common adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, there is more occaſion given him to glory at that union that is betwixt hereticks and errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons, and ſuch who profeſſe to be Saints; and the ſcandal is greater, becauſe the Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry will give it out they are all corrupt, they are unſound, they are all hereticks, all erroneous corrupt perſons, for they mix together, and at leaſt there is an allowance; this is juſtly more ſcandalous then the other, nay the other is not ſcandalous at all; but it is the glory of the Saints in the preſence of their enemies, to keep themſelves from all corrupt things and perſons, what profeſſion ſoever they make.</p>
               <p>3. There is a tampering with opinions that are unſound, and with perſons alſo who are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, by which means it comes to paſſe that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lay themſelves under ſtrong temptations, and through the righteous hand of the Lord they come to be left to errour, and become as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt as any. There are ſome, and not a few, that take great delight to talk with all kind of perſons, who hold any ſtrange opinion, as bring any new doctrine, and if there be any book into which any poyſon of corrupt doctrine is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled, they will uſe all means to get ſuch a book, and will chooſe rather to read therein then in
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:48559:208"/> any other, till at length they be changed into the ſame image, and be principled alike to the perſons and books they are ſo converſant with. Now this evil proceeds,</p>
               <p n="1">1. From an opinion that ſome hold, that it is the duty of Chriſtians to try all things, and to keep that which is good; but the commandment of the Apoſtle is miſtaken; for firſt, this trying reſpects all the doctrines and ſpirits of men that we are called neceſſary to partake of, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant in; ſo the doctrines of our own Paſtors and Teachers muſt be tryed, and of others alſo, whom providence leads us to hear, and it reſpects the knowledge of doctrines whereto we have not yet attained; but we are not by vertue of this commandment, to rake into all opinions that are or have been among Apoſtate Chriſtians; nor is it a duty to be alwayes trying, but we muſt be rooted, and grounded, and eſtabliſhed as we have been taught. And this is a commandment of the Apoſtle, whereto we ought to attend; and we muſt leave the principles, and paſſe on to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, that is, having laid them in the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we muſt build higher and higher upon them, till we come to a perfect man in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From a preſumption which perſons have of their own ſtrength, they think there is no danger, but that they ſhall be able well enough to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the evill in any opinion, and not be hurt by it, and in the interim they may read or hear ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:48559:209"/> that may edifie them. But indeed the moſt of theſe are unacquainted with their own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and they know not the depth of Satan till they fall by them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From ſome decay of appetite, ſo farre as concernes feeding upon wholſome nouriſhing truths, for it is a ſymptome of a weak diſtemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtomack, that it would behold variety of meats, but it cannot feed upon any; ſo when the ſoule is carried out to curioſity, to be looking and pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all things, that any are carried to, it is to be feared that it feeds upon nothing which may build it up and ſtrengthen it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Error comes to be ſpread by the temerity, invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilancy, inſobriety, &amp; imprudence of many Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; ſome are ſudden in entertaining of opinions, &amp; not ſober; ſome are cloſe and ſecret in their ſearch and enquiry after them, and never diſcover any thing till they be formed within them, and till themſelves come to be formed into the ſimilitude of them, and then it becomes an hard work to deſtroy that which is ſo firmly received; and ſome over-match themſelves, while they oppoſe their underſtanding parts and abilities to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect and ſharpneſſe of apprehenſion, and dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouſneſſe of wit, and vaſtneſſe of parts, and ſtrength of braine, that falſe Teachers and Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers have; by which means it comes to paſſe that they are eaſily overcome, and advantage is given to the erroneous to propagate their corrupt opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:48559:209"/> Whereas there ought to be great delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, much conſultation, open heartedneſſe alſo in perſons to their owne Paſtors and Overſeers, or dear friends whom they may confide in, and a calling out for help where it is moſt like to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded, that ſuch doctrines may be debated upon equall terms, before they be received.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The countenance and encouragement that is given to perſons that bring unſound and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripturall doctrine; and the applauſes and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes wherewith they are followed by ſome high ones, and holy ones, (it may be for ſome parts that are eminent in them, and for ſome dreſſe of holineſſe that they appear in) do give life and ſtrength to ſuch doctrines; for when great ones and godly ones are become admirers and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of ſuch perſons, and harbour them, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them, the eyes of others are thereby turned after them; and there will be many that in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be found to ſtrengthen the hands of ſuch evill workers and ſeducers that do traverſe the land, and to ſtrengthen their errors alſo.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If it once come to paſſe that any eminent ones in office, intereſt, abilities, graces, upon whom the eyes of many people are, and who are leading perſons in the places where they live, and after whoſe example many go; if any ſuch be left of God to ſtrange doctrine, they will draw away many diſciples after them, and the land will in a ſhort time be filled with error, if there be not
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:48559:210"/> ſome mercifull providences to prevent the diffuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it: And when it begins to take hold of Saints, it is moſt likely to increaſe, for then there is honour put upon it, while it lodgeth in ſuch ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, while temperizers and ſelf-ſeeking perſons (which were men of carnall and low principles) harboured it, it was of baſe repute and proſpered not, but gets a better name by getting into heads and hearts of beleevers.</p>
               <p>The third thing that comes to be diſcuſſed is the meanes of cure how perſons may come to be healed of errors, and errors may come to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed in them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There muſt be an encountring with ſuch er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous doctrines, and they muſt be brought to ſcriptural tryall, and there they muſt be arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and thence they muſt be condemned. The reaſon is, becauſe they are preſented with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of Scripture, Scripture is made uſe of to uſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er them in, elſe they could get no entrance, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Scripture muſt throw them out again; And Seducers mouths will not be ſtopped any other way, nor will their followers be undeceived any other way; Therefore there is a neceſſity that the truth ſhould be held out, and ſtrongly forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with Scripture and with agrument, by which the mind may be filled with light, and that error ſhould be confuted, and the nakedneſſe and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didneſſe thereof detected, that thoſe that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous may come to be aſhamed, that have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heared
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:48559:210"/> to it, and may learn to abhorre it, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 9, 10. An Elder or Biſhop muſt be able by ſound doctrine to convince gain-ſayers, <hi>for there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, whoſe mouths muſt be ſtopped, &amp;c.</hi> This place is worthy of obſervation, for is ſhewes what ought to be done in theſe times. And look how many wayes error hath been propagated, ſuch wayes ſhould be taken for the ſpreading of truth. The contrary truths to the grand errors of this age ought to be held out in words that cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by preaching, printing, letters written, private communication and ſuggeſtion by open conferences alſo and diſputes, and happy are thoſe that have gifts and hearts to contribute any thing this way. See we the ſedulity and induſtry of <hi>Paul</hi> this way, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 31. <hi>for the space of three yeeres I coaſed not</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>to warne every one of you night and day with tears.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The care and vigilancy of the Churches of Chriſt, and of the Officers and Overſeers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, muſt be ſhewed towards their own mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, which relate to them, for the healing of any that have been ſhaken, or have departed from the faith; for, for that end are they aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated together, that they might watch over one another; and the Elders are principally called forth to this work, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 31. <hi>Therefore Watch;</hi> why, what is the matter? and he tels us, becauſe grievous wolves ſhall enter in among
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:48559:211"/> you, not ſparing the flock; and of your ſelves men ſhall ariſe, ſpeaking perverſe things, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away diſciples after them, <hi>therefore watch.</hi> And in order to a Churches diſcharging of its du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty this way, it is neceſſary in theſe times, wherein the members of Churches are ſcattered abroad through many Providences, and wherein errour is very prevalent, for the Churches of Chriſt, and the watchmen thereof. 1. To ſend to all ſuch, (who are at diſtance from them, and live in dangerous places) to know their faith, leaſt they ſhould be tempted, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 5. which place, though it may reſpect the grace of faith, which through affliction may be ſhaken, yet it will hold in proportion in reference to the doctrine of faith. And though the Apoſtle declareth what he did, yet therein he is a pattetne what thoſe that have a flock committed to them ought to do; for without doubt what power the Apoſtles had for edification, and not for deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, over all the Churches and Members there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the ſame hath each Church, and the Officers thereof, over thoſe that ſtand related to them. And ſuch who ſo belong to ſuch Churches, and have ſuch Overſeers, are bound to render an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in a Chriſtian way, it is a duty by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Peters</hi> Precept, but much rather is there an obligation where there is ſuch a relation.</p>
               <p>2. It is neceſſary for the Churches to put this burden upon ſuch members of theirs, where ſuch
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:48559:211"/> danger is of ſeducers, (if they will count it a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den) to abſtain from the fellowſhip of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who are not ſound in doctrines among them, becauſe the Apoſtle requires it, <hi>Rom</hi> 16. 17. 2 <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 8, 9, 10. and becauſe there is a double benefit in it. 1. To ſuch which erre ſo dangerouſly, they may come to be awakened and afterward aſhamed. 2. To thoſe that ſhun them, and decline them, they come to be kept thereby, and preſerved from their errour. 3. It is the duty of the Church and watchmen thereof, to withſtand ſuch who are falſe teachers, and who deceive thoſe of their flock by their lies, as <hi>Paul</hi> reſiſted <hi>Elimas,</hi> who would turn away the Deputy from the faith, and as the ſhepheard is bound to chaſe away the wolfe for the ſafety of the flock. 4. The Church and Elders there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ought to be warning ſuch of theirs that are in danger, that is, to be preſenting them with the evil and danger of ſuch doctrine, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them the horrid effects and conſequences which will follow upon it, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 31. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how I warned you,</hi> and in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. he ſhews the evil conſequences of denying the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, which they ſaw not, but made light of it, but the Apoſtle had looked into it, &amp; did faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully hold it forth to them. 5. The Church of Chriſt and the Rulers thereof ought to reject and caſt out ſuch among theirs who are heady and high, and are not reclaimed from ſuch errours
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:48559:212"/> which they have ſucked in from ſuch ſeducers, which have been among them, after they have clearly held out the truth, and detected the contrary errour, and confuted it; and after they have admoniſhed and warned ſuch, once, or twice, or thrice, or while there is hope. It is clear from the Apoſtles example, in delivering up <hi>Hymeneus</hi> for no other fault but for denying the Reſurrection, and troubling others with that doctrine. And alſo from the Apoſtles direction given to <hi>Titus, Tit.</hi> 3. 10, 11. <hi>An heretick after once or twice admonition reject, &amp;c.</hi> And indeed <hi>avoiding</hi> ſuch, and <hi>not receiving</hi> ſuch, nor ſaying <hi>Gods ſpeed</hi> to ſuch, is an high cenſure, little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that of delivering up to Satan.</p>
               <p>Obj.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the queſtion may be, what edification there can be in paſſing ſuch a ſentence upon one that erres in doctrine, either to him that is ſo cenſured, or to others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Groſſe errours or hereſies are not fallen into, eſpecially not perſiſted in (after a cleare light held out) through ſimple ignorance, but through ſome diſtemper of the Will, and ſome temptation upon the ſpirit. Now though the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Church hath no aptitude in it to give light where it was wanting to open their eyes, to rectifie an erring judgement, to convince the conſcience, or ſatisfie doubts and ſcruples, which did ariſe through ſimple ignorance, yet the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Church may be a means to heal the
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:48559:212"/> will, and to remove the temptation from the ſpirit, what ever it be which may obſtruct the right exerciſe of that light, and underſtanding which ſuch perſons have; and firſt the cenſure of the Church may occaſion a more ſerious and deep ſearching into the truth, or falſhood of doctrines, and may cure that precipitancy and headineſſe, and raſhneſſe, in entertaining and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging in doctrines that are not ſound and ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural. There is a vanity of ſpirit, which luſteth after new opinions, which cauſeth ſuch facilenes in receiving, that doctrines are no ſooner pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, but they are taken up, but Church-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings may be a means to bring on ſobriety. 2. That partiality which is in perſons in reference unto thoſe whom they reſpect and affect, may come to be healed, for nothing is more frequent then to hold opinions and tenents, with reſpect to perſons, but this diſtemper is many times beſt cured, through the execution of Church power 3. If the truth be departed from for advantage ſake, that perſons thereby may riſe up to great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er honour or preferment, Church diſcipline gives a check many times to ſuch luſts of the fleſh, that they cannot prevaile with that ſtrength as before they did; when the love of them carried perſons to corrupt ingagements that way. 4. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are ingaged to that opinion which they have turned aſide to, leaſt they ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted fickle and wavering, when yet they
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:48559:213"/> want Scripture-ſtrength to maintain them; but this perverſenes and obſtinacy is beſt cured by the admonitions and withdrawings of the Church from ſuch perſons. 5. And if there ſhould be any darkneſſe in the judgement, in reference to plain and clear doctrines, where ſuch darkneſſe was not before; it is argument to me that God hath juſtly put out their eyes, in reference to ſomething that hath diſpleaſed him, and till they have been aſhamed, and have ſhewed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, God will not diſpel nor ſcatter the clouds, nor clear up their judgements; Now Church admonition is the beſt expedient to bring them to repentance, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>Hymeneus, I have delivered him up to Satan</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that he may learne not to blaſpheme,</hi> that is, by denying a doctrine which he ought to have profeſſed. And ſo ſuch ſcales of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance which were by ſin contracted, are by Church-cenſure removed many times.</p>
               <p>Obj.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But what if ſuch perſons be very holy in their lives, and very profitable in their Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, muſt they notwithſtanding undergo the cenſure of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. There is no holineſſe but what flows from the doctrine of the Goſpel, rightly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and held by faith. Therefore ſo long as they waver in the faith in points of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment and moment, their holineſſe muſt of neceſſity be waved alſo; the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:48559:213"/> 7, 8. <hi>Though I or an Angel from heaven bring any other Goſpel</hi> (and yet he means it of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion held by ſome as neceſſary to ſalvation) <hi>let him be accurſed.</hi> 2. Such perſons that are pertinacious in a corrupt opinion, are evil leaven, and their Communion cannot be ſo profitable, as it is like to be hurtful to the fellowſhip to which they do belong. 3. If they be Saints which do ſo greatly erre from the faith, there ought to be ſo much the more compaſſion ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, and the greateſt love and compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that can be ſhewed lies in this, to uſe the laſt remedy to them, when other remedies fail, and are ineffectual; and it is the greateſt cruelty to withhold any means which God hath ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for the healing of ſuch, as from <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears.</p>
               <p>5. What one Church of Jeſus Chriſt doth this way in the execution of cenſure, juſtly and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to rule, all the Churches ought to ratifie; for if ſuch who are bound by any Church on earth, be bound alſo in heaven, then all the Churches in the world have not power to acquit or loſe from it; therefore in their walking towards ſuch perſons (great or ſmall) they ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it, by having no Communion nor fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with ſuch, that ſo ſuch perſons may come to ſee the miſerable condition that they are in, and may be aſhamed; and if any Churches or Chriſtians ſhould walk otherwiſe, they ſin againſt
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:48559:214"/> Chriſts ordinance, and harden ſuch perſons in their ſin, and hinder their repentance, and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the truth, and will draw the blood of ſuch ſouls upon their heads.</p>
               <p>If this courſe were held with ſuch who erre groſſely, and will not be healed, it would awaken thoſe who have left their firſt faith, and are tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned after fables, and might recover them, and would bring a trembling upon the reſt, that ſtand firme and unſhaken, and might preſerve them from the like temptations, and then there would be no cauſe for the interpoſing of the Magiſtrate, which ſome do reliſh ſo evilly.</p>
               <p>The fourth and laſt thing that I am to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuſſe is, what the preſervatives are by which perſons may be kept, in times in which errours are rife, and the danger great in that reſpect.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let every perſon that pretends to ſaintſhip look to his implantation into Chriſt, that it be right and true, and that it be firme and ſure, and then it is to be hoped that he will abide in the Vine, and the Vine in him, and then he is more likely to ſtand faſt in the faith, for there is one that is able to keep him from falling, and will keep him, and if he fall he ſhall riſe againe; for there is one that is able to raiſe him, and will raiſe him; The greateſt ſecurity of the Saints, that they ſhall not depart from the faith, is in their union and communion with Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let perſons commit themſelves to God, to be
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:48559:214"/> kept by him, who can ſtrengthen and ſettle, and eſtabliſh thoſe that reſt on him, and wait for him; while perſons have leaned to their own underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and have not looked up to the rock that is higher then they, and come out of themſelves, and put their truſt in him, and begged his teaching and leading, they have become vain in their thoughts, and have erred from the truth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let perſons get a good root of knowledge within themſelves, and not attain onely to a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall knowledge of things, but come up to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular knowledge of them, and know all things in the cauſes thereof, ſo farre as Scripture gives light, or as they have been taught; for then, though ſome other thing may be preſented to them, then what they have received, yet the reaſons of the things which they have beleeved, will not be ſo ſoon anſwered in their ſouls. If perſons have but a forme of knowledge within them, it is ſoon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturned.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let the love of the truth be laboured after, as well as the knowledge of it, for perſons will be unwilling to relinquiſh that truth which they have found much ſweetneſſe in.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Let the Scriptures be diligently ſearched in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and peruſed, and ſtudied, and let them be compared together, and let Scripture intepret it ſelfe, and let one Scripture give the ſenſe of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scripture, when perſons take up ſome one or two ſingle ſcriptures, and runne away with them,
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:48559:215"/> without comparing them with other Scriptures, they are led aſide to error.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Chriſtians ought to take heed whom they hear, what they hear, and how they hear, becauſe of many Seducers and Deceivers, that are gone abroad into the world, and becauſe there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſpirits of Antichriſt, who yet pretend to Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Chriſtians ought to become wiſe unto ſobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, <hi>and not to think of themſelves above what is meet,</hi> but to have humble and low thoughts of themſelves, for if once Chriſtians be lifted up, they readily fall in this ſnare of the Devill, which is Error and Hereſie.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Chriſtians ought to walk up to that light of truth that they have attained to, becauſe there is a promiſe belonging to ſuch who will live in and practiſe the truths which they know, <hi>John</hi> 7. 17.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Saints ought to conſider that they have no more of the grace of faith, then they hold of the doctrin of faith, for they therfore beleeve becauſe they have ſuch a word of God to ground their belief upon; if then they hold not that Word, their belief will fall with it, and then muſt needs be ſhaken, as much in the grace of faith, as they are in the ground of faith.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Let them conſider that there is no godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe but what grows out of the Goſpel, and ſprings from the truths of it, if therefore the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of grace in Chriſt be once overturned in the ſoule, all godlineſſe will be ſoon overturned with it. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 3. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 1.</p>
               <p n="11">
                  <pb n="431" facs="tcp:48559:215"/> 11. Let them conſider that if once they become unſtable in the faith, they become unſtable in all their wayes, for it is as when a tree is not firmly &amp; deeply and ſurely rooted in the earth, but is looſe in the ground, it growes not, flouriſheth not, nor is fruitful like to other trees; therfore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>unleſſe you abide in me,</hi> that is, firmly and ſurely hold me, <hi>ye cannot bring forth fruit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. Let all Chriſtians take heed how they hold the truth in unrighteouſneſſe, how they put away a good conſcience in any thing and ſo tempt God, leſt God give them up to darkneſſe, as a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch an offence.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Let every Chriſtian joyn to ſome Church of Jeſus Chriſt that walks cloſely with God in the truth, that by the watchings of others he may be the better kept. This is regular walking and God will be ſure to bleſſe it.</p>
               <p>4 Let not any Chriſtians run into temptations, leaſt God ſhould leave them under the power of them, and ſuffer them to be overcome of them; but if they hear or read a doctrine that is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to what they received, let them with much fear and trembling hear and read it; and with much looking up to heaven for guidance; &amp; let them be ſlow in entertaining that which is new &amp; ſtrange to them; and after much examination &amp; conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and abundant confirmation out of Scripture, let them do it. If Saints will walk in this way, the God of truth and grace will be with them, &amp; they ſhall be kept unto ſalvation.</p>
